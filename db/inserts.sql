&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java prettyprint-override&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &amp;lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            // Primary loop
            for (int c = 0; c &amp;lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {
                if (data[c] &amp;gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(&quot;sum = &quot; + sum);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is going on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is a sorted array faster to process than an unsorted array?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go from tutorials found on the Internet, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;there are very many very bad C++ books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting &lt;em&gt;glaringly obvious factual errors&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;promoting abysmally bad programming styles&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc. Books that meet the criteria will be added to the list.

This requires iterating over n/2 * n/4 = n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/8 socks on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, the question is basically:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a pile of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; pairs of socks, containing &lt;code&gt;2n&lt;/code&gt; elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space? (I believe I can remember that amount of info if needed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will appreciate an answer that addresses the following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A general &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; solution for a huge number of socks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual number of socks is not that large, I don&#x27;t believe my spouse and I have more than 30 pairs. (And it is fairly easy to distinguish between my socks and hers; can this be used as well?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it equivalent to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem&quot;&gt;element distinctness problem&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;splice()&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;anArray.splice(index, 1);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;delete&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;delete anArray[index];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful when you use delete for an array. It is good for deleting attributes of objects but not so good for arrays. It is better to use &lt;code&gt;splice&lt;/code&gt; for arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that when you use &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; for an array you could get wrong results for &lt;code&gt;anArray.length&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; would remove the element but wouldn&#x27;t update the value of length property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also expect to have holes in index numbers after using delete, e.g. you could end up with having indexes 1,3,4,8,9,11 and length as it was before using delete. 
In that case, all indexed &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops would crash, since indexes are no longer sequential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are forced to use &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; for some reason, then you should use &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329446/for-each-over-an-array-in-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;for each&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; loops when you need to loop through arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

This is largely because it does not attempt to be an introduction to &lt;em&gt;programming&lt;/em&gt;, but an introduction to &lt;em&gt;C++&lt;/em&gt; for people who&#x27;ve previously programmed in some other language. It has a steeper learning curve, but, for those who can cope with this, it is a very compact introduction into the language.

Earlier editions were aimed at programmers coming from C, the third edition changes this and targets programmers coming from languages like Java. It presents ~50 easy-to-remember rules of thumb along with their rationale in a very accessible (and enjoyable) style. For C++11 and C++14 the examples and a few issues are outdated and Effective Modern C++ should be preferred. &lt;a href=&quot;http://accu.org/index.php?module=bookreviews&amp;amp;func=search&amp;amp;rid=700&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;[Review]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It covers everything from the very basics to some of the most advanced template metaprogramming and explains every detail of how templates work (both conceptually and at how they are implemented) and discusses many common pitfalls.

There are a ton of snippets in this book, some of which are made obsolete by typetraits, but the techniques, are nonetheless useful to know.  If you can put up with the quirky formatting/editing, it is easier to read than Alexandrescu, and arguably, more rewarding.  For more experienced developers, there is a good chance that you may pick up something about a dark corner of C++ (a quirk) that usually only comes about through extensive experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Be aware, however, that it is intended purely as a reference for &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt; users willing to devote considerable time and effort to its understanding.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201834545&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside the C++ Object Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Stanley Lippman)  If you want to know how virtual member functions are commonly implemented and how base objects are commonly laid out in memory in a multi-inheritance scenario, and how all this affects performance, this is where you will find thorough discussions of such topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201514591&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Annotated C++ Reference Manual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Bjarne Stroustrup, Margaret A. Ellis) This book is quite outdated in the fact that it explores the 1989 C++ 2.0 version - Templates, exceptions, namespaces and new casts were not yet introduced. Saying that however this is book goes through the entire C++ standard of the time explaining the rationale, the possible implementations and features of the language. This is not a book not learn programming principles and patterns on C++, but to understand every aspect of the C++ language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I put together &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsfiddle.net/KMQZK/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a jsFiddle&lt;/a&gt; that does a comparison and tries to boil down the differences to the simplest explanations I could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Closures done right:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log(&#x27;CLOSURES DONE RIGHT&#x27;);

var arr = [];

function createClosure(n) {
    return function () {
        return &#x27;n = &#x27; + n;
    }
}

for (var index = 0; index &amp;lt; 10; index++) {
    arr[index] = createClosure(index);
}

for (var index in arr) {
    console.log(arr[index]());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above code &lt;code&gt;createClosure(n)&lt;/code&gt; is invoked in every iteration of the loop. Note that I named the variable &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; to highlight that it is a &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; variable created in a new function scope and is not the same variable as &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; which is bound to the outer scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a new scope and &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is bound to that scope; this means we have 10 separate scopes, one for each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;createClosure(n)&lt;/code&gt; returns a function that returns the n within that scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within each scope &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is bound to whatever value it had when &lt;code&gt;createClosure(n)&lt;/code&gt; was invoked so the nested function that gets returned will always return the value of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; that it had when &lt;code&gt;createClosure(n)&lt;/code&gt; was invoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Closures done wrong:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log(&#x27;CLOSURES DONE WRONG&#x27;);

function createClosureArray() {
    var badArr = [];

    for (var index = 0; index &amp;lt; 10; index++) {
        badArr[index] = function () {
            return &#x27;n = &#x27; + index;
        };
    }
    return badArr;
}

var badArr = createClosureArray();

for (var index in badArr) {
    console.log(badArr[index]());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above code the loop was moved within the &lt;code&gt;createClosureArray()&lt;/code&gt; function and the function now just returns the completed array, which at first glance seems more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might not be obvious is that since &lt;code&gt;createClosureArray()&lt;/code&gt; is only invoked once only one scope is created for this function instead of one for every iteration of the loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within this function a variable named &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; is defined. The loop runs and adds functions to the array that return &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt;. Note that &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; is defined within the &lt;code&gt;createClosureArray&lt;/code&gt; function which only ever gets invoked one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there was only one scope within the &lt;code&gt;createClosureArray()&lt;/code&gt; function, &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; is only bound to a value within that scope. In other words, each time the loop changes the value of &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt;, it changes it for everything that references it within that scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the functions added to the array return the SAME &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; variable from the parent scope where it was defined instead of 10 different ones from 10 different scopes like the first example. The end result is that all 10 functions return the same variable from the same scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the loop finished and &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; was done being modified the end value was 10, therefore every function added to the array returns the value of the single &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; variable which is now set to 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;

Unfortunately, they decided to call the location of an object a &quot;reference&quot;.  When we pass the value of an object, we are passing the &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt; to it.  This is confusing to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static void main( String[] args ) {
    Dog aDog = new Dog(&quot;Max&quot;);
    // we pass the object to foo
    foo(aDog);
    // aDog variable is still pointing to the &quot;Max&quot; dog when foo(...) returns
    if (aDog.getName().equals(&quot;Max&quot;)) { // true, java passes by value }
    if (aDog.getName().equals(&quot;Fifi&quot;)) { // false }
}

public static void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals(&quot;Max&quot;); // true
    // change d inside of foo() to point to a new Dog instance &quot;Fifi&quot;
    d = new Dog(&quot;Fifi&quot;);
    if (d.getName().equals(&quot;Fifi&quot;)) { // true }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://ideone.com/oUEPbg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;aDog.getName()&lt;/code&gt; will still return &lt;code&gt;&quot;Max&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. The value &lt;code&gt;aDog&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is not changed in the function &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;&quot;Fifi&quot;&lt;/code&gt; as the object reference is passed by value. If it were passed by reference, then the &lt;code&gt;aDog.getName()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; would return &lt;code&gt;&quot;Fifi&quot;&lt;/code&gt; after the call to &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static void main( String[] args ) {
    Dog aDog = new Dog(&quot;Max&quot;);
    foo(aDog);
    // when foo(...) returns, the name of the dog as been changed to &quot;Fifi&quot;
    aDog.getName().equals(&quot;Fifi&quot;); // true
}

public void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals(&quot;Max&quot;); // true
    // this changes the name of d to be &quot;Fifi&quot;
    d.setName(&quot;Fifi&quot;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, &lt;code&gt;FiFi&lt;/code&gt; is the dog&#x27;s name after call to &lt;code&gt;foo(aDog)&lt;/code&gt; because the object&#x27;s name was set inside of &lt;code&gt;foo(...)&lt;/code&gt;. Any operations that &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; performs on &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; are such that, for all practical purposes, they are performed on &lt;code&gt;aDog&lt;/code&gt; itself (except when &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is changed to point to a different &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt; instance like &lt;code&gt;d = new Dog(&quot;Boxer&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Most pages rely so heavily on JavaScript that they simply don&#x27;t work without JS properly anymore. Besides, the given fallbacks (href to &quot;&quot;, &quot;#&quot;, or &quot;js..(void)) don&#x27;t add any benefit except add the open in new tab functionality that will reopen the same page without the intended function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all these drawbacks with no real benefit, using the href on a non link is a bad practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correct way to determine whether something is visible is to consult your view-model. If you don&#x27;t know what that means then you are about to embark on a journey of discovery that will make your work a great deal less difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s an overview of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;model-view-viewmodel&lt;/a&gt; architecture (MVVM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://knockoutjs.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;KnockoutJS&lt;/a&gt; is a binding library that will let you try this stuff out without learning an entire framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&#x27;s some JS and a DIV that may or may not be visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/knockout/3.4.1/knockout-min.js&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
var vm = {
  IsDivVisible: ko.observable(true);
}
vm.toggle = function(data, event) {
  //get current visibility state for the div
  var x = IsDivVisible();
  //set it to the opposite
  IsDivVisible(!x);
}
ko.applyBinding(vm);
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div data-bind=&quot;visible: IsDivVisible&quot;&amp;gt;Peekaboo!&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;button data-bind=&quot;click: toggle&quot;&amp;gt;Toggle the div&#x27;s visibility&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the toggle function does not consult the DOM to determine the visibility of the div, it consults the view-model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am just adding two cents for @Kyralessa&#x27;s answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure what to use go for &lt;code&gt;--soft&lt;/code&gt; (I used this convention to remember it --&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;oft for safe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose &lt;code&gt;--hard&lt;/code&gt; by mistake you will &lt;strong&gt;LOSE&lt;/strong&gt; your changes as it wasn&#x27;t before.
If you choose &lt;code&gt;--soft&lt;/code&gt; by mistake you can achieve the same results of &lt;code&gt;--hard&lt;/code&gt; by applying additional commands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset HEAD file.html
git checkout -- file.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Full example&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &quot;some changes...&quot; &amp;gt; file.html
git add file.html
git commit -m &quot;wrong commit&quot;

# I need to reset
git reset --hard HEAD~1 (cancel changes)
# OR
git reset --soft HEAD~1 # Back to staging
git reset HEAD file.html # back to working directory
git checkout -- file.html # cancel changes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git command to undo the last commit/ previous commits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic command to revert the commit in Git is:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git reset --hard &amp;lt;COMMIT -ID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git reset --hard HEAD~&amp;lt;n&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMIT-ID&lt;/strong&gt;: ID for the commit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;n:&lt;/strong&gt;  is number of last commits you want to revert&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get the commit id as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ **git log --oneline**

d81d3f1 function to subtract two numbers

be20eb8 function to add two numbers

bedgfgg function to mulitply two numbers
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;strong&gt;d81d3f1&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;be20eb8&lt;/strong&gt; are commit id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now let&#x27;s see some cases:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suppose you want to revert the last commit &#x27;d81d3f1&#x27;. Below are the ways:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git reset --hard d81d3f1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suppose you want to revert the commit &#x27;be20eb8&#x27;. Below are the way:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git reset --hard be20eb8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In speaking of Git-related commands in the previous answers, I would like to share my typical Git cycles with all readers which may helpful. Here is how I work with Git,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloning the first time from the remote server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone $project&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulling from remote (when I don&#x27;t have a pending local commit to push)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a new local file1 into $to_be_committed_list (just imagine $to_be_committed_list means &lt;code&gt;staged&lt;/code&gt; area)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add $file1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing mistakenly added file2 from $to_be_committed_list (assume that file2 is added like step 3, which I didn&#x27;t want)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset $file2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committing file1 which is in $to_be_committed_list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -m &quot;commit message description&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syncing local commit with remote repository before pushing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git pull --rebase&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git mergetool #resolve merging here, also can manually merge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding conflict-resolved files, let&#x27;s say &lt;code&gt;file1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add $file1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git rebase --continue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Basically at midnight at the end of 1927, the clocks went back 5 minutes and 52 seconds. So &quot;1927-12-31 23:54:08&quot; actually happened twice, and it looks like Java is parsing it as the &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt; possible instant for that local date/time - hence the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just another episode in the often weird and wonderful world of time zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Stop press! History changes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original question would no longer demonstrate quite the same behaviour, if rebuilt with  version 2013a of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/blob/master/src/NodaTime.Demo/StackOverflowExamples.cs#L68&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;TZDB&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013a, the result would be 358 seconds, with a transition time of 23:54:03 instead of 23:54:08.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only noticed this because I&#x27;m collecting questions like this in Noda Time, in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/blob/master/src/NodaTime.Demo/StackOverflowExamples.cs#L68&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;unit tests&lt;/a&gt;... The test has now been changed, but it just goes to show - not even historical data is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; History has changed again...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In TZDB 2014f, the time of the change has moved to 1900-12-31, and it&#x27;s now a mere 343 second change (so the time between &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;t+1&lt;/code&gt; is 344 seconds, if you see what I mean).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; To answer a question around a transition at 1900... it looks like the Java timezone implementation treats &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; time zones as simply being in their standard time for any instant before the start of 1900 UTC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import java.util.TimeZone;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        long startOf1900Utc = -2208988800000L;
        for (String id : TimeZone.getAvailableIDs()) {
            TimeZone zone = TimeZone.getTimeZone(id);
            if (zone.getRawOffset() != zone.getOffset(startOf1900Utc - 1)) {
                System.out.println(id);
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code above produces no output on my Windows machine. So any time zone which has any offset other than its standard one at the start of 1900 will count that as a transition. TZDB itself has some data going back earlier than that, and doesn&#x27;t rely on any idea of a &quot;fixed&quot; standard time (which is what &lt;code&gt;getRawOffset&lt;/code&gt; assumes to be a valid concept) so other libraries needn&#x27;t introduce this artificial transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen size:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Actual physical size, measured as the screen&#x27;s diagonal. For simplicity, Android groups all actual screen sizes into
  four generalized sizes: small, normal, large, and extra large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen density:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The quantity of pixels within a physical area of the screen; usually referred to as dpi (dots per inch). For example, a
  &quot;low&quot; density screen has fewer pixels within a given physical area,
  compared to a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;high&quot; density screen. For simplicity,
  Android groups all actual screen densities into four generalized
  densities: low, medium, high, and extra high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orientation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The orientation of the screen from the user&#x27;s point of view. This is either landscape or portrait, meaning that the
  screen&#x27;s aspect ratio is either wide or tall, respectively. Be aware
  that not only do different devices operate in different orientations
  by default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user
  rotates the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The total number of physical pixels on a screen. When adding support for multiple screens, applications do not work directly
  with resolution; applications should be concerned only with screen
  size and density, as specified by the generalized size and density
  groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Density-independent pixel (dp):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or
  position in a density-independent way. The density-independent pixel
  is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the
  baseline density assumed by the system for a &quot;medium&quot; density screen.
  At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp
  units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use.
  The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi
  / 160). For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical
  pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your
  application&#x27;s UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on screens with
  different densities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function multiplier(n) {
    function multiply(x) {
          return n*x;

var x = 10xmultiplier(5); // x= 50
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can see that even after multiplier has finished executing, the inner function multiply gets still access to the value of x which is 10 in this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very common use of closures is currying (the same example above) where we spice our function progressively with parameters instead of supplying all of the arguments at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can achieve this because Javascript (in addition to the prototypal OOP) allows as to program in a functional fashion where higher order functions can take other functions as arguments (fisrt class functions).

&lt;p&gt;Four years after the PhD, I am pretty sure that I am going to leave academia soon. I do enjoy teaching and research, but the alpha-maleness, massive egos and pressure to publish are really unappealing to me, and I have never felt that I had the mathematical power to prove interesting results. However, I am really having trouble thinking of anything else to do. Most people seem to think that the main careers open to mathematicians are in banking and finance. I really want to work in some field where I can use mathematics, but it is also important to me to feel like I am contributing something positive or at least not actively doing harm. For this reason, financial speculation is very unappealing to me, although I do find the underlying mathematics quite fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

INSERT INTO postinstance (post_id, user_id, description) VALUES (116, 5, "&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s my problem. I&#x27;m studying math and when I really work hard, I think I understand things very good, but that comes at a big cost: in the last few years, I&#x27;ve had practically zero physical exercise, I&#x27;ve gained 30&amp;nbsp;kg, I&#x27;ve spent countless hours studying at night, constantly had sleep deprivation, I&#x27;ve lost my social life, and I got health problems. My grades are quite good, but I feel as though I&#x27;m wasting my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love mathematics when it&#x27;s done my way, but that&#x27;s hardly ever. I would very much like my career to be centered around mathematics (topology, algebra or something similar). I want to really understand things and I want the proofs to be done in a (reasonably) rigorous way. I&#x27;ve been accused of being a formalist before, but I don&#x27;t consider myself one at all. However, I am a perfectionist, I admit. For comparison, the answers of Theo, Arturo, Jim Belk, Mariano, etc. are absolutely rigorous enough for me. From my experience, 80% or more mathematics in our school is done in a sketchy, &quot;hmm, probably true&quot; kind of way (just like reading cooking recipes), which bugs the hell out of me. Most classmates adapt to it. I for some reason can&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t understand things until I understand them (almost) completely. They learn &quot;how one should do things&quot;, but less often do they ask themselves WHY is this correct. I have two friend physicists, who have the exact same problem. One is at the doctorate level, constantly frustrated, while the other abandoned physics altogether after getting a diploma. Apart from one 8, he had a perfect record, only 10s. He said that he doesn&#x27;t feel he understands physics well enough. From my experience, ALL his classmates understand less than he does, they just go with the flow and accept certain statements as true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my problem is having weak memory. I forget a lot. Having to study a different subject each day is killing me. If it were up to me, I&#x27;d change the way lectures are done. We&#x27;d study only ONE subject for a month or two, then have the exams, and the next month or two the next subject. Mixing it up has a terrible effect: I forget things, because I constantly change the topic. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m always behind schedual. For example, in the second year, during the school year, I understood almost nothing of multivariable calculus, because I had to simultaneously study abstract algebra, topology, computer programming, etc, and couldn&#x27;t keep up. But then, I devoted the whole three months of summer and got through all 330 pages of theory, understood it very good, including all the proofs ( which I was forgetting along the way), got a 9/10 grade, and had absolutely no vacations (stayed at home), no free time, no sport, no nothing. It was complete crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should I not read the proofs at all?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should I try less hard, get worse grades and understanding, and &#x27;have a life&#x27;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abandon the idea of doing math for a living?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how can I spot the important/illustrative proofs, &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; studying them completely (it often happens, that I &#x27;get the whole point&#x27; only after I&#x27;ve understood the whole proof)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not gifted/bright at all, I&#x27;m completely &lt;strong&gt;average with a bad memory&lt;/strong&gt;, but I do have interest in math, good grades, and a horrible lifestyle for the last few years. &lt;strong&gt;This question is directed at people who have a career doing mathematics. How did you manage to study everything on time, AND sufficiently rigorous, that you were able to understand it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADDITIONS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often tend to be the only one to find serious issues in the proofs, in the formulations of theorems, and also in the worked out exercises at classes. Everyone else either understands everything/most, or doesn&#x27;t understand and also doesn&#x27;t care for possible issues. Often do I find holes in the proofs and that hypotheses are missing in the theorem. When I present them to the professor, he says that I&#x27;m right, and says that I&#x27;m very precise. How is this precise, when the theorem doesn&#x27;t hold in it&#x27;s current state. Are we even supposed to understand proofs. Are the proofs actually really just sketches? How on earth is one then supposed to be able to discover mathematical truths? Is the study of mathematics just one big joke and you&#x27;re not supposed to take it too seriously?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of sports I like and used to do. Also, I had a perfectly good social life before, so you don&#x27;t need to give advice regarding that. I don&#x27;t socialize and do sport because digesting proofs and trying to understand the ideas behind it all eats up all my time. If I go hiking, it will take away 2 days, 1 to actually walk + 1 to rest and regenerate. If I go train MMA, I won&#x27;t be focused for the whole day. I can&#x27;t just switch from boxing to diagram chasing in a moment. Also, I can&#x27;t just study for half an hour. The way I study is I open the book, search up what I already know but forgot from the previous day, and then go from theorem to theorem, from proof to proof, correcting mistakes, adding clarifications, etc. etc. Also, I have a bad habit of having &lt;strong&gt;difficulty starting&lt;/strong&gt; things, but when I do start &#x27;my engine&#x27;, I have &lt;strong&gt;difficulty stopping&lt;/strong&gt;, especially if it&#x27;s going good. That&#x27;s why I unintentionally spend an hour or two before studying just doing the most irrelevant stuff, just to avoid study. This happens especially when I&#x27;ve had more math than I can shove down my throat, I have mental preparations to begin studying. But when my engine does start and studying goes well (proven a lot, understood a lot), it&#x27;s hard for me to stop, so I often stay late at night, up to 4&amp;nbsp;a.m., 5&amp;nbsp;a.m., 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. When the day of the exam arrives, I don&#x27;t go to sleep at all, and the &lt;strong&gt;night and day are reversed&lt;/strong&gt;. I go to sleep at 13h, and wake at 21h... I know it&#x27;s not good but I can&#x27;t seem to break this habit. If I&#x27;m useless through the whole day, I &lt;strong&gt;feel a need (guilty conscience) to do at least smth. useful before I go to sleep&lt;/strong&gt;. I know this isn&#x27;t supposed to happen if one loves mathematics, but when it&#x27;s &#x27;forced upon you&#x27; what and how much and in what amount of time you have to study, you start being put off by math. It stops being enjoyment/fun and becomes hard work that just needs to be done.

However, they found the way how both of them will have a lunch without feeling deceived: One of them will cut the sandwich in two halves, and another will choose which half will be his. Fair, right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/n7S6i.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Split sandwich&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is there such mechanism for three people and a sandwich?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: This was roller-coaster for me. Now, it turns out that there are at least two &lt;strong&gt;books&lt;/strong&gt; devoted exclusively on this problem and its variations:&lt;/p&gt;

Would  some of my buddies just interrupt me and say: Stop! You are not cutting the cake in a fair manner! My hands started shaking in fear of that. But, no, nothing happened. Fortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

I showed him a  &quot;trick&quot; where I turned it right-side-out by pulling the whole thing through a sleeve instead of the bottom or collar of the shirt. He thought it was really cool (kids are easily amused, and so am I).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he learned that you can turn a shirt or pants right-side-out by pulling the material through any hole, not just certain ones. I told him that even if there was a rip in the shirt, you could use that to turn it inside-out or right-side-out, and he was fascinated by this and asked &quot;why?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t really know the answer to this. Why is this the case? What if the sleeves of a long-sleeve shirt were sewn together at the cuff, creating a continuous tube from one sleeve to the other? Would you still be able to turn it right-side-out? Why? What properties must a garment have so that it can be turned inside-out and right-side-out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is a lame question, but I&#x27;ve always wondered. I wouldn&#x27;t even know what to google for, so that is why I am asking here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you know the answer to this, could you please put it into layman&#x27;s terms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that the answer is that you need at least one puncture in the garment through which to push or pull the fabric. It appears that you can have certain handles, although it&#x27;s not usually practical with clothing due to necessary stretching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yields the golden ratio $x = \phi$, which can easily be proven by rewriting it as $x = 1 + 1/x$, solving the resulting quadratic equation and assuming that a continued fraction that only contains additions will give a positive number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a friend asked me what would happen if we replaced all additions with subtractions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
x = 1 - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - \ldots}}

Every proof I&#x27;m aware of uses quite a bit of commutative algebra and non-trivial theorems such as Krull&#x27;s intersection theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently T. Coquand and H. Lombardi have found a surprisingly elementary &quot;almost&quot; first-order characterization of the Krull dimension, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://hlombardi.free.fr/publis/KrullMathMonth.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For $l \in \mathbb{N}$ we have $\dim(R) \leq l$ if and only if for all $x_0,\dotsc,x_l \in R$ there are $a_0,\dotsc,a_l \in R$ and $m_0,\dotsc,m_l \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_0^{m_0} (\dotsc ( x_l^{m_l} (1+a_l x_l)+\dotsc)+a_0 x_0)=0$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consequence of this is a new short proof of $\dim(K[x_1,\dotsc,x_n])=n$, where $K$ is a field. Using Noether normalization and the fact that integral extensions don&#x27;t change the dimension, it follows that $\dim(R \otimes_K S)=\dim(R)+\dim(S)$ if $R,S$ are finitely generated $K$-algebras. In particular $\dim(R[T])=\dim(R)+1$. This could be useful for introductory courses on algebraic geometry which don&#x27;t want to waste too much time with dimension theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Can we use this elementary characterization of the Krull dimension to give a new short proof of $\dim(R[T])=\dim(R)+1$ for noetherian commutative rings $R$?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this question is a bit naive. I suspect that this can only work if we find a first-order property of rings which is equivalent or even weaker than noetherian and prove the formula for these rings. Notice that in contrast to that the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension satisfies $\mathrm{GK}\dim(R[T])=\mathrm{GK}\dim(R)+1$ (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://ysharifi.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/gk-dimension-of-polynomial-rings/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) for every $K$-algebra $R$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, this second statement is less logically unsound than the first since it&#x27;s not difficult to see the reason why the sequence must continue as such; nevertheless, the statement was made on a premise that boils down to &quot;interesting patterns must always continue&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to counter this logic by creating a ridiculous argument like &quot;the numbers $1,2,3,4,5$ are less than $100$, so surely all numbers are&quot;, but this usually fails to be convincing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FeiaZ.gif&quot; alt=&quot;40 and 70&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rim6Z.gif&quot; alt=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that after $n=60$-ish, the &quot;circle&quot; of solutions started to expand into a band of solutions with a defined outline.  To fully absorb the weirdness of this, I animated the solutions from $n=2$ to $n=112$.  The following is the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/hlExV.gif&quot; alt=&quot;n=2 to 112&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty weird right!?  Anyhow, here are my questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, has anybody ever seen anything at all like this before?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What&#x27;s up with those &quot;tails?&quot;  They seem to occur only on even $n$, and they are surely distinguishable from the rest of the solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Look how the &quot;enclosed&quot; solutions rotate as $n$ increases.  Why does this happen?&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strong&gt;[Explained in edits.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Anybody have any idea what happens to the solution set as $n\rightarrow \infty$?&lt;/strike&gt;
  Thanks to @WillSawin, we now know that &lt;strong&gt;all the roots are contained in an annulus that converges to the unit circle&lt;/strong&gt;, which is fantastic.  So, the final step in understanding the limit of the solution sets is figuring out what happens &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the unit circle.  We can see from the animation that there are many gaps, particularly around certain roots of unity; however, they do appear to be closing.
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The natural question is, which points on the unit circle &quot;are roots in the limit&quot;? In other words, what are the accumulation points of $\{z\left|z\right|^{-1}:z\in\mathbb{C}\text{ and }f_n(z)=0\}$?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the set of accumulation points dense?  @NoahSnyder&#x27;s heuristic of considering these as a random family of polynomials suggests it should be- at least, almost surely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;These are polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.  Can anybody think of a way to rewrite the formula (perhaps recursively?) for the simplified polynomial, with no denominator?  If so, we could use the new formula to prove the series converges to a function on the unit disc, as well as cut computation time in half.&lt;/strike&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;[See edits for progress.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Does anybody know a numerical method specifically for finding roots of high degree polynomials?  Or any other way to efficiently compute solution sets for high $n$?&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strong&gt;[Thanks @Hooked!]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone.  This may not turn out to be particularly mathematically profound, but it sure is &lt;em&gt;neat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks to suggestions in the comments, I cranked up the working precision to maximum and recalculated the animation.  As Hurkyl and mercio suspected, the rotation was indeed a software artifact, and in fact evidently so was the thickening of the solution set.  The new animation looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/1asy8.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Working precision to 10^-50.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that solves one mystery: the rotation and inflation were caused by tiny roundoff errors in the computation.  With the image clearer, however, I see the behavior of the cusps more clearly.  Is there an explanation for the gradual accumulation of &quot;cusps&quot; around the roots of unity?  (Especially 1.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: Here is an animation $Arg(f_n)$ up to $n=30$.  I think we can see from this that $f_n$ should converge to some function on the unit disk as $n\rightarrow \infty$.  I&#x27;d love to include higher $n$, but this was already rather computationally exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/P5EzF.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Avoid this if you&amp;#39;ve been taking any hallucinogenic drugs.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve been tinkering and I may be onto something with respect to point $5$ (i.e. seeking a better formula for $f_n(x)$).  The folowing claims aren&#x27;t proven yet, but I&#x27;ve checked each up to $n=100$, and they seem inductively consistent.  Here denote $\displaystyle f_n(x)=\sum_{m}a_{n,m}x^m$, so that $a_{n,m}\in \mathbb{Z}$ are the coefficients in the simplified expansion of $f_n(x)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I found $\text{deg}(f_n)=\text{deg}(f_{n-1})+\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$.  The solution to this recurrence relation is $$\text{deg}(f_n)=\frac{1}{2}\left({\left\lceil\frac{1-n}{2}\right\rceil}^2 -\left\lceil\frac{1-n}{2}\right\rceil+{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}^2 + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\right)=\left\lceil\frac{n^2}{4}\right\rceil.$$&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If $f_n(x)$ has $r$ more coefficients than $f_{n-1}(x)$, the leading $r$ coefficients are the same as the leading $r$ coefficients of $f_{n-2}(x)$, pairwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When $n&amp;gt;m$, $a_{n,m}=a_{n-1,m}+\rho(m)$, where $\rho(m)$ is the number of integer partitions of $m$.  (This comes from observation, but I bet an actual proof could follow from some of the formulas &lt;a href=&quot;http://oeis.org/A000041&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  For $n\leq m$ the $\rho(m)$ formula first fails at $n=m=6$, and not before for some reason.  There is probably a simple correction term I&#x27;m not seeing - and whatever that term is, I bet it&#x27;s what&#x27;s causing those cusps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, with this, we can make &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; make a recursive relation for $a_{n,m}$,
$$a_{n,m}= \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll}
       a_{n-2,m+\left\lceil\frac{n-2}{2}\right\rceil^2-\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil^2} &amp;amp; : \text{deg}(f_{n-1}) &amp;lt; m \leq \text{deg}(f_n)\\
       a_{n-1,m}+\rho(m) &amp;amp; : m \leq \text{deg}(f_{n-1})  \text{ and } n &amp;gt; m \\
       ? &amp;amp; : m \leq \text{deg}(f_{n-1})  \text{ and } n \leq m
     \end{array}
   \right.
$$
but I can&#x27;t figure out the last part yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:
Someone pointed out to me that if we write $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n(x)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty b_{m} x^m$, then it appears that $f_n(x)=\sum_{m=0}^n b_m x^m + O(x^{n+1})$.  The $b_m$ there seem to me to be relatively well approximated by the $\rho(m)$ formula, considering the correction term only applies for a finite number of recursions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if we have the coefficients up to an order of $O(x^{n+1})$, we can at least prove the polynomials converge on the open unit disk, which the $Arg$ animation suggests is true.  (To be precise, it looks like $f_{2n}$ and $f_{2n+1}$ may have different limit functions, but I suspect the coefficients of both sequences will come from the same recursive formula.)  With this in mind, I put a bounty up for the correction term, since from that all the behavior will probably be explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: The limit function proposed by Gottfriend and Aleks has the formal expression $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f_n(x)=1+\prod_{m=1}^\infty \frac{1}{1-x^m}.$$
I made an $Arg$ plot of $1+\prod_{m=1}^r \frac{1}{1-x^m}$ for up to $r=24$ to see if I could figure out what that ought to ultimately end up looking like, and came up with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rb6Lx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purely based off the plots, it seems not entirely unlikely that $f_n(x)$ is going to the same place this is, at least inside the unit disc.  Now the question is, how do we determine the solution set at the limit?  I speculate that the unit circle may become a dense combination of zeroes and singularities, with fractal-like concentric &quot;circles of singularity&quot; around the roots of unity...  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you come across the novel term &lt;em&gt;vector space&lt;/em&gt;, and want to learn more about it.  You look up various definitions, and they all refer to something called a &lt;em&gt;field&lt;/em&gt;.  So now you&#x27;re off to learn what a &lt;em&gt;field&lt;/em&gt; is, but it&#x27;s the same story all over again: all the definitions you find refer to something called a &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt;.  Off to learn about what a &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; is.  Ad infinitum.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m calling here &quot;to go down the &lt;em&gt;Math Rabbit Hole&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon first encountering the situation described above one may think: &quot;well, if that&#x27;s what it takes to learn about vector spaces, then I&#x27;ll have to toughen up, and do it.&quot;   I picked this particular example, however, because I&#x27;m sure that the course of action it envisions is one that is not just arduous: it is in fact utterly misguided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can say so with some confidence, for this particular case, thanks to some serendipitous personal experience.  It turns out that, luckily for me, some kind calculus professor in college gave me the tip to take a course in linear algebra (something that I would have never thought of on my own), and therefore I had the luxury of learning about vector spaces without having to venture into the dreaded &lt;em&gt;MRH&lt;/em&gt;.  I did well in this class, and got a good intuitive grasp of vector spaces, but even after I had studied for my final exams (let alone the first day of class), I couldn&#x27;t have said what a &lt;em&gt;field&lt;/em&gt; was.  Therefore, from my experience, and that of pretty much all my fellow students in that class, I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that one does not need to know a whole lot about fields to get the hang of vector spaces.  All one needs is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;familiarity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; field ($\mathbb{R}$, say).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it&#x27;s hard to pin down more precisely what this &lt;em&gt;familiarity&lt;/em&gt; amounts to.  The only thing that I can say about it is that it is a state somewhere between, and &lt;em&gt;quite distinct&lt;/em&gt; from, (a) the state right after reading and understanding the definition of whatever it is one wants to learn about (say, &quot;vector spaces&quot;), and (b) the state right after (say) acing a graduate-level pure math course in that topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even harder than defining this &lt;em&gt;familiarity&lt;/em&gt; is coming up with an &lt;em&gt;efficient&lt;/em&gt; way to attain it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;d like to ask all the math autodidacts reading this: how do you avoid falling into the &lt;em&gt;Math Rabbit Hole&lt;/em&gt;?  And more specifically, how do you &lt;em&gt;efficiently&lt;/em&gt; attain enough &lt;em&gt;familiarity&lt;/em&gt; with pre-requisite concepts to move on to the topics that you want to learn about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: John von Neumann allegedly once said &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/q/11267/12400&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Young man, in mathematics you don&#x27;t understand things. You just get used to them.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  I think that this &quot;getting used to things&quot; is much of what I&#x27;m calling &lt;em&gt;familiarity&lt;/em&gt; above.  The problem of learning mathematics &lt;em&gt;efficiently&lt;/em&gt; then becomes the problem of &quot;getting used to things&quot; quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Several answers and comments have suggested to use textbooks rather than, e.g., the Wikipedia, to learn math.  But textbooks usually have the same problem.  There are exceptions, like Gilbert Strang&#x27;s books, which generally avoid technicalities and instead focus on the big picture, and they are indeed ideal introductions to a subject, but they are &lt;em&gt;exceedingly&lt;/em&gt; rare.  For example, as I already mentioned in one comment, I&#x27;ve been looking for an intro book on homotopy theory that focuses on the big picture, to no avail; all the books I&#x27;ve found bristle with technicalities from the get go: Hausdorff this, locally compact that, yadda yadda...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m sure that when one mathematician asks another for an introduction to some branch of math, the latter does not start spewing all these formal technicalities, but instead gives a big-picture account, based on simple examples.  I wish authors of mathematics books sometimes wrote books in such an informal vein.  Note that I&#x27;m not talking here about books written for math-phobes (in fact I detest it when a math book adopts a condescending &quot;for-dummies&quot;, &quot;let&#x27;s-not-fry-our-little-brains-now&quot; tone).  Informal does not mean &quot;dumbed down&quot;.  There&#x27;s a huge gap in the mathematics literature (at least in English), and I can&#x27;t figure out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(BTW, I&#x27;m glad that MJD brought up Strang&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Linear Algebra&lt;/em&gt; book, because it&#x27;s a concrete example that shows it&#x27;s not impossible to write a successful math textbook that stays on the big picture, and doesn&#x27;t fuss over technicalities.  It goes without saying that I&#x27;m not advocating that all math books be written this way.  Attention to such technical details, precision, and rigor are all essential to doing mathematics, but they can easily overwhelm an introductory exposition.)&lt;/p&gt;

She has a low grade in her math course and only ever attempts to memorize formulas and tricks, but never actually learn any of the reasoning behind the math. Cross multiplication is the perfect example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She knows that from&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$\frac{3}{5}=\frac{x}{10}$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.. she can &quot;cross multiply&quot; to get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$30 = 5x$ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.. and from there get $x=6$. She has absolutely no idea what any of this means, however. She&#x27;s simply memorized a pattern and is applying that pattern to a recognizable arrangement of numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the incremental nature of math, her performance has gotten worse as her lack of understanding has compounded. She&#x27;ll occasionally ask me for help, but is always upset that I won&#x27;t simply give her the answer to the problem at hand or the &quot;formula&quot; for what she&#x27;s trying to do. As I ask questions to test her understanding of something, she begins to randomly guess numbers either out of thin air or numbers that I&#x27;d mentioned in my explanations, but &lt;strong&gt;she doesn&#x27;t appear to be actually thinking about the problem and considering the answer.&lt;/strong&gt; After about an hour, she begins to claim she&#x27;s tired, can no longer focus, and that we&#x27;re spending too much time on a single problem and that she has more to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for my finally posting this question and reaching out to the mathematics community came from the homework she had today. She wanted to know how to find the circumference of a circle. After a few questions I had determined that she had no idea what the radius, diameter, or circumference of a circle even were. She even attempted to guess &quot;area&quot; at one point. After relating circumference to the circumnavigation she had learned about, radius to the rays of a sun, and diameter to meaning two (even though this isn&#x27;t the proper etymology of diameter), she was at least able to label the parts of a circle. Instead of giving her the $c=\pi d$ formula she wanted so badly, I wanted her to understand that $\pi$ represented the amount of times the diameter &quot;fits&quot; into the circumference and that this is the relation between the parts of the circle. I measured as accurately as possible the perimeter and diameter of the mouth of a cup I had and showed her that dividing the numbers produced approximately pi. This unfortunately didn&#x27;t provide the &quot;ohhh&quot; response I was looking for, which signified that she didn&#x27;t intuitively understand division. So I tried with a much simpler example. Our conversation went something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The circumference of the glass divided by the diameter gave me pi, what does that mean?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Er... I don&#x27;t know?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, if I divide 10 by 2, what do I get?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Five&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;.. and what does that mean? How many twos are in ten&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;five twos go into ten?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Right, so if I divide the circumference by the diameter and get pi, how many diameters are in the circumference?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;..umm... seven?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;WHAT?!? Why seven?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;..uhh, two?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;why two?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;because diameter means two?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;two what?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;two radius&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so on ad infinitum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She doesn&#x27;t have any learning disabilities or mental handicaps, so it irritates me to no end that she won&#x27;t put any effort into learning things that are essential to her understanding and that she could easily grasp. &lt;/p&gt;

The question is: are there any interesting theorems that you think would be a good example to tell Richard Feynman, as an answer to his challenge?  Theorems should be totally counter-intuitive, and be easily translatable to everyday language.  (Apparently Banach-Tarski paradox was not a good example.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then I got an idea.  I challenged
  them: &quot;I bet there isn&#x27;t a single
  theorem that you can tell me - what
  the assumptions are and what the
  theorem is in terms I can understand -
  where I can&#x27;t tell you right away
  whether it&#x27;s true or false.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It often went like this: They would
  explain to me, &quot;You&#x27;ve got an orange,
  OK? Now you cut the orange into a
  finite number of pieces, put it back
  together, and it&#x27;s as big as the sun.
  True or false?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No holes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Impossible!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ha! Everybody gather around! It&#x27;s
  So-and-so&#x27;s theorem of immeasurable
  measure!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Just when they think they&#x27;ve got
  me, I remind them, &quot;But you said an
  orange! You can&#x27;t cut the orange peel
  any thinner than the atoms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But we have the condition of
  continuity: We can keep on cutting!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, you said an orange, so I
  assumed that you meant a real orange.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;So I always won. If I guessed it
  right, great. If I guessed it wrong,
  there was always something I could
  find in their simplification that they
  left out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was updating my answer to the question &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/94827/books-that-every-student-needs-to-go-through&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; during which I made the claim that &quot;I spend a lot of time sifting through books to find [the best source]&quot;. It strikes me now that while I love books (I really do) I often find that I learn best from sets of lecture notes and short articles. There are three particular reasons that make me feel this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Lecture notes and articles often times take on a very delightful informal approach.  They generally take time to bring to the reader&#x27;s attention some interesting side fact that would normally be left out of a standard textbook (lest it be too big). Lecture notes and articles are where one generally picks up on historical context, overarching themes (the &quot;birds eye view&quot;), and neat interrelations between subjects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.It is the informality that often allows writers of lecture notes or expository articles to mention some &quot;trivial fact&quot; that every textbook leaves out. Whenever I have one of those moments where a definition just doesn&#x27;t make sense, or a theorem just doesn&#x27;t seem right it&#x27;s invariably a set of lecture notes that sets everything straight for me. People tend to be more honest in lecture notes, to admit that a certain definition or idea confused them when they first learned it, and to take the time to help you understand what finally enabled them to make the jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Often times books are very outdated. It takes a long time to write a book, to polish it to the point where it is ready for publication. Notes often times are closer to the heart of research, closer to how things are learned in the modern sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is because of reasons like this that I find myself more and more carrying around a big thick manila folder full of stapled together articles and why I keep making trips to Staples to get the latest set of notes bound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if anyone knows of any set of lecture notes, or any expository articles that fit the above criteria, please do share!&lt;/p&gt;

$x = x + 1$, or $x = 1/0$?&lt;/p&gt;

OK, a lot of people have said that a number $x$ such that $x = x + 1$ would break the rule that $0 \neq 1$. However, let&#x27;s look at the extension from whole numbers to include negative numbers (yes, I said that I wasn&#x27;t going to include this) by defining $-1$ to be the number such that $-1 + 1 = 0$. Note that this breaks the &quot;rule&quot; that &quot;if $x \leq y$, then $ax \leq ay$&quot;, which was true for all $a, x, y$ before the introduction of negative numbers.

&lt;p&gt;My mom gave me a roll of toilet paper to put it in the bathroom, and looking at it I immediately wondered about this: is it possible, through very simple math, to calculate (with small error) the total paper length of a toilet roll? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing down some math, I came to this study, which I share with you because there are some questions I have in mind, and because as someone rightly said: for every problem there always are at least 3 solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by outlining the problem in a geometrical way, namely looking only at the essential: the roll from above, identifying the salient parameters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/stAVS.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/stAVS.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parameters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$r = $ radius of internal circle, namely the paper tube circle;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$R = $ radius of the whole paper roll;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$b = R - r = $ &quot;partial&quot; radius, namely the difference of two radii as stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I treated the whole problem in the discrete way. [See the end of this question for more details about what does it mean]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a discrete way, the problem asks for the total length of the rolled paper, so the easiest way is to treat the problem by thinking about the length as the sum of the whole circumferences starting by radius $r$ and ending with radius $R$.
But how many circumferences are there? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one of the main points, and then I thought about introducing a new essential parameter, namely the thickness of a single sheet. Notice that it&#x27;s important to have to do with measurable quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling $h$ the thickness of a single sheet, and knowing $b$ we can give an estimate of how many sheets $N$ are rolled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$N = \frac{R - r}{h} = \frac{b}{h}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having to compute a sum, the total length $L$ is then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$L = 2\pi r + 2\pi (r + h) + 2\pi (r + 2h) + \cdots + 2\pi R$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$L = 2\pi (r + 0h) + 2\pi (r + h) + 2\pi (r + 2h) + \cdots + 2\pi (r + Nh)$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which obviously $2\pi (r + 0h) = 2\pi r$ and $2\pi(r + Nh) = 2\pi R$.
Writing it as a sum (and calculating it) we get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{align}
L = \sum_{k = 0}^N\ 2\pi(r + kh) &amp;amp; = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1}\ 2\pi(r + kh)
\\\\
&amp;amp; = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + 2\pi \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1} r + 2\pi h \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1} k
\\\\
&amp;amp; = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + 2\pi r(N-1) + 2\pi h\left(\frac{1}{2}N(N-1)\right)
\\\\
&amp;amp; = 2\pi r N + 2\pi R + \pi hN^2 - \pi h N
\end{align}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using now: $N = \frac{b}{h}$; $R = b - a$ and $a = R - b$ (because $R$ is easily measurable), we arrive after little algebra to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\boxed{L = 4\pi b + 2\pi R\left(\frac{b}{h} - 1\right) - \pi b\left(1 + \frac{b}{h}\right)}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$h = 0.1$ mm; $R = 75$ mm; $b = 50$ mm thence $L = 157$ meters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which might fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Could it be a good approximation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) What about the $\gamma$ factor? Namely the paper compression factor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Could exist a similar calculation via integration over a spiral path? Because actually it&#x27;s what it is: a spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for the time spent for this maybe tedious maybe boring maybe funny question!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know a fair few examples of things that are obviously true and that can be proved to be true (like the Jordan curve theorem).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what are some theorems (preferably short ones) which, when put into layman&#x27;s terms, the average person would claim to be true, but, which, actually, are false
(i.e. counter-intuitively-false theorems)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only ones that spring to my mind are the Monty Hall problem and the divergence of $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}$ (counter-intuitive for me, at least, since $\frac{1}{n} \to 0$
).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose, also, that $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n = e=\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}$$ is not obvious, since one &#x27;expects&#x27; that $\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n \to (1+0)^n=1$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m looking &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt; for theorems and not their (dis)proof -- I&#x27;m happy to research that myself.&lt;/p&gt;

INSERT INTO postinstance (post_id, user_id, description) VALUES (149, 83, "&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of the oldschool games and I once noticed that there is a sort parity associated to one and only one Tetris piece, the $\color{purple}{\text{T}}$ piece.  This parity is found with no other piece in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; The Tetris playing field has width $10$.  Rotation is allowed, so there are then exactly $7$ unique pieces, each of which is composed of $4$ blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For convenience, we can name each piece by a letter.  See this &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris#Colors_of_Tetriminos&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page for the Image&lt;/a&gt; ($\color{cyan}{\text{I}}$ is for the stick piece, $\color{goldenrod}{\text{O}}$ for the square, and $\color{green}{\text{S}},\color{purple}{\text{T}},\color{red}{\text{Z}},\color{orange}{\text{L}},\color{blue}{\text{J}}$ are the others)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are $2$ sets of $2$ pieces which are mirrors of each other, namely $\color{orange}{\text{L}}, \color{blue}{\text{J}}$ and $\color{green}{\text{S}},\color{red}{\text{Z}}$ whereas the other three are symmetric $\color{cyan}{\text{I}},\color{goldenrod}{\text{O}}, \color{purple}{\text{T}}$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language:&lt;/strong&gt; If a row is completely full, that row disappears.  We call it a &lt;strong&gt;perfect clear&lt;/strong&gt; if no blocks remain in the playing field.  Since the blocks are size 4, and the playing field has width $10$, the number of blocks for a perfect clear must always be a multiple of $5$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Question:&lt;/strong&gt;  I noticed while playing that the $\color{purple}{\text{T}}$ piece is particularly special.  It seems that it has some sort of parity which no other piece has.  Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conjecture&lt;/strong&gt;:  If we have played some number of pieces, and we have a perfect clear, then the number of $\color{purple}{\text{T}}$ pieces used must be even.  Moreover, the $\color{purple}{\text{T}}$ piece is the only piece with this property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have verified the second part; all of the other pieces can give a perfect clear with either an odd or an even number used.  However, I am not sure how to prove the first part.  I think that assigning some kind of invariant to the pieces must be the right way to go, but I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

I have asked on the meta site and believe the question to be suitable and hopefully interesting for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to explain the puzzle as best I can then detail the questions I am interested in after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine squared paper.  In one square write the number 1.  Continue to write numbers from left to right (as normal) until you reach a prime.  The next number after a prime should be written in the square located 90 degrees clockwise to the last.  You then continue writing numbers in that direction. This procedure should be continued indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample  of the grid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\begin{array}{} 7&amp;amp;8&amp;amp;9&amp;amp;10&amp;amp;11&amp;amp;40&amp;amp;41 \\6&amp;amp;1&amp;amp;2&amp;amp;&amp;amp;12&amp;amp;&amp;amp;42\\5&amp;amp;4&amp;amp;3&amp;amp;14&amp;amp;13&amp;amp;44&amp;amp;43\\&amp;amp;&amp;amp;34&amp;amp;&amp;amp;26\\&amp;amp;&amp;amp;33&amp;amp;&amp;amp;27\\&amp;amp;&amp;amp;32&amp;amp;&amp;amp;28\\&amp;amp;&amp;amp;31&amp;amp;30&amp;amp;29\end{array}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the square containing 3 also contains 15 (I couldn&#x27;t put it in without confusing the diagram.  In fact some squares contain multiple entries.
I would have liked to see an expanded version of the diagram.  I originally thought of shading squares that contain at least one number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions&lt;/strong&gt;
Does the square surrounded by $2,3,9,10,11,12,13,14$ ever get shaded?
If so, will the whole grid ever be shaded?
Is there a maximum number of times a square can be visited?  I have got to 4 times but it is easy to make mistakes by hand.
Are there any repeated patterns in the gaps?
I have other ideas but this is enough for now as I have genuinely no idea how easy or difficult this problem is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please forgive me for not taking it any further as it is so easy to make mistakes.
I hope this is interesting for the community and look forwards to any results.
Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any questions I&#x27;ll do my best to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: I observed that initially at least the pattern likes to cling to itself but I suspect it doesn&#x27;t later on.&lt;/p&gt;

The game has two players and begins with a commutative Noetherian ring $R$. Player one mods out a nonzero non-unit, and gives the resulting ring to player 2, who repeats the process. The last person to make a legal move (i.e. whoever produces a field) wins. For PIDs the game is trivial: player 1 wins by modding out a single prime element. However, the game becomes far more complicated even in the case of 2-dimensional UFDs. After several days I was unable to determine a winning strategy for either player for $\mathbb Z[x]$. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the most tractable class of rings are finitely generated commutative algebras over an algebraically closed field $K$, as for these we can take advantage of the nullstellensatz. So far, I&#x27;ve been able to deal with the cases of $K[x]$ and $K[x,y]$. Player 1 has a trivial winning strategy for $K[x]$, as it is a PID. For $K[x,y]$, player 1 has a winning strategy as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player 1 plays $x(x+1)$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player 2 plays $f(x,y)$ which vanishes somewhere on $V(x(x+1))$ but not everywhere (this describes all legal moves). Note that $V(f(x,y),x(x+1))$ is a finite collection of points possibly union $V(x)$ or $V(x+1)$ but not both. Furthermore, $V(f(x,y),x(x+1))$ cannot be a single point as the projection of $V(f(x,y))$ onto the $x$-axis yields an algebraic set, which must either be a finite collection of points or the entire line and so intersects $V(x(x+1))$ in at least two points, thus $R/(x(x+1),f(x,y))$ is not a field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player 1 plays $ax+by+c$ which vanishes at exactly one point in $V(f(x,y),x(x+1))$. This is always possible, since any finite collection of points can be avoided and the lines $V(x)$ or $V(x+1)$ will intersect $V(ax+by+c)$ at most once. The resulting ring is a field, as the ideal $I$ generated by the three plays contains either $(ax+by+c,x)$ or $(ax+by+c,x+1)$, which are maximal, hence is equal to one of these and $R/I$ is a field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I&#x27;ve no idea where to go for $K[x,y,z]$ and beyond. I suspect that $K[x,y,z]$ is a win for player 2, since anything player 1 plays makes the result look vaguely like $K[x,y]$, but on the other hand player 1 could make some pretty nasty plays which might trip up any strategy of player 2&#x27;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is: which player has a winning strategy for $K[x,y,z]$, and what is one such strategy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; As pointed out in the comments, this winning strategy is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

be our base space. 
There is in fact a group structure $+: \mathcal{R} \times \mathcal{R}\to \mathcal{R}$ given by $([X],[Y]) \mapsto [X_1 \sqcup Y]$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe unsurprisingly, the identity is $[\emptyset]$, but here is the weird part:
$[X \sqcup X]=\partial (M \times [0,1])$ so in fact, $[X]+[X]=[\emptyset]$, and each element is its own inverse (idempotent.) Really, we can turn this whole thing into a $\mathbb Z_2$ vector space, and use cartesian product as a multiplicative structure to obtain a graded algebra, but I think the groups are interesting enough in their own right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll list below the first few from wikipedia:, starting with $\mathcal{R}_1$ and increasing in dimension:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\mathbb Z/2, 0, \mathbb Z/2, 0, \mathbb Z/2 \oplus \mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2.$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; add an answer in the form of finite calculus. You can read about this topic in the book &lt;em&gt;Concrete Mathematics&lt;/em&gt; of Graham and Knuth, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/publications/Gleich%202005%20-%20finite%20calculus.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finite calculus is analogous to the normal (infinitesimal) calculus where we use instead &quot;discrete derivatives&quot; and &quot;discrete integrals&quot; (actually just summations), and we can perform defined or undefined sums in analogy to defined or undefined integrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analogously to the standard derivative the discrete derivative and the discrete (undefined) integral can be written as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta f(k):=f(k+1)-f(k),\quad\quad \sum f(k)\delta k=F(k)+C\tag{1}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for some $1$-periodic function $C$, and where we have too that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\sum_{k=a}^bf(k)=\sum\nolimits_a^{b+1}f(k)\delta k\tag{2}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have the summation by parts formula with this symbology represented by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\sum f(k)[\Delta g(k)]\delta k=f(k)g(k)-\sum \mathrm [E g(k)]f(k)\delta k\tag{3}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where $\mathrm E$ is the &lt;em&gt;shift operator&lt;/em&gt; and is defined as $\mathrm E f(k):=f(k+1)$. By last, before to answer the question, it is not hard to check that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta x^k=x^k(x-1),\quad\sum x^k\delta k=x^k(x-1)^{-1}+C\\\Delta (k+w)=1,\quad \sum (k+w)\delta k=\frac12 (k+w-1)(k+w)+C\tag{4}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, using the above formulas, we have that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\begin{align}\sum_{k=0}^\infty (k+1)x^k&amp;amp;=\sum\nolimits_0^\infty (k+1)x^k\delta k\\&amp;amp;=(k+1)x^k(x-1)^{-1}\big|_0^\infty-\sum\nolimits_0^\infty x^{k+1}(x-1)^{-1}\delta k\\&amp;amp;=[(k+1)x^k(x-1)^{-1}-x^{k+1}(x-1)^{-2}]\big|_0^\infty\end{align}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the above is finite when $|x|&amp;lt;1$, in this case we have that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\sum_{k=0}^\infty (k+1)x^k=-\frac1{x-1}+\frac{x}{(x-1)^2}=\frac1{(x-1)^2}$$&lt;/p&gt;

We refer to that function as the derivative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As pointed out in the original question many calculus one books these days even try to define differentials loosely and at least informally point out that for differentials $dy = f&#x27;(x) dx$ (Note that both sides of this equation act on vectors, not on points). Both $dy$ and $dx$ are perfectly well defined functions on vectors and their ratio is therefore a perfectly meaningful function on vectors. Since it is constant on fibers (minus the zero section), then that well defined ratio descends to a function on the original space.&lt;/p&gt;

How it works, as Arturo said, is we allow infinitesimals (by using the hyperreal number system). It is well formulated, and I prefer it to limit notions, as this is how it was invented. Its just that they weren&#x27;t able to formulate it correctly back then. I will give a slightly simplified example. Let us say you are differentiating $y=x^2$. Now let $dx$ be a miscellaneous infinitesimals (it is the same no matter which you choose if your function is differentiate-able at that point.) $$dy=(x+dx)^2-x^2$$
$$dy=2x\times dx+dx^2$$
Now when we take the ratio, it is:
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=2x+dx$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note:Actually,$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is what we found in the beginning, and $dy$ is defined so that $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ rounded to the nearest real number.)&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is: lets interpret $dx$ and $dy$ as functions on $T\mathbb R^2$, as if they were differential forms. For each tangent vector $v$, set $dx(v):=v(x)$. If we identify $T\mathbb R^2$ with $\mathbb R^4$, we get that $(x,y,dx,dy)$ is just the canonical coordinate system for $\mathbb R^4$. If we exclude the points where $dx=0$, then $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$ is a perfectly healthy equation, its solutions form a subset of $\mathbb R^4$. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s see if it makes any sense. If we fix $x$ and $y$, the solutions form a straight line through the origin of the tangent space at $(x,y)$, its slope is $2x$. So, the set of all solutions is a distribution, and the integral manifolds happen to be the parabolas $y=x^2+c$. Exactly the solutions of the differential equation that we would write as $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$. Of course, we can write it as $dy = 2xdx$ as well. I think this is at least a little bit interesting.

&lt;p&gt;To change the scale of the drawing just change the &lt;code&gt;pensize&lt;/code&gt; variable to another positive integer. Note that the pen is rounded, so the path will have noticeable rounded corners for &lt;code&gt;pensize &amp;gt; 3&lt;/code&gt;; this may or may not be desirable. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily modify this script to draw some alternate prime paths. All primes &gt; 3 are of the form $6n\pm 1$. So we can turn right if prime $i \mod 6 = 1$, or turn left for the other primes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that change the code in the &lt;code&gt;if v:&lt;/code&gt; block to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if v:
    dx = 1 if i % 6 == 1 else -1
    step_index = (step_index + dx) % 4
    st = steps[step_index]
    t.right(90 * dx)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All primes &gt; 2 are of the form $4n\pm 1$. This is perhaps more important than the $6n\pm 1$ distinction since primes of the form $4n-1$ are also prime in the Gaussian integers; 2 and primes of the form $4n+1$ can be written as the sum of two squares and can thus be factorised in the Gaussian integers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can make the path turn right for $4n+1$ primes and left for the other primes by changing the modulus in the &lt;code&gt;dx&lt;/code&gt; assignment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    dx = 1 if i % 4 == 1 else -1

I&#x27;d rather not edit the previous one anymore so here goes another response.  I want to make clear, this response is to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, not your 10-year-old nephew.  How you translate this response to any person depends more on you and that person than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page for diffeomorphism&lt;/a&gt;. In particular,the lead image &lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Diffeomorphism_of_a_square.svg/220px-Diffeomorphism_of_a_square.svg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at that image I see the standard Cartesian coordinate grid, but deformed a little. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/2D_Cartesian_Coordinates.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a &quot;big theorem&quot; in a subject called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Manifold Theory&lt;/a&gt; and it&#x27;s name is the &quot;Isotopy Extension Theorem&quot;.  Moreover, it has a lot to do with these kinds of pictures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The isotopy extension theorem is roughly this construction: say you have some rubber, and it&#x27;s sitting in a medium of liquid epoxy that&#x27;s near-set.  Moreover, imagine the epoxy to be multi-coloured.  So when you move the rubber bit around in the epoxy, the epoxy will &quot;track&quot; the rubber object.  If your epoxy had a happy-face coloured into it originally, after you move the rubber, you&#x27;ll see a deformed happy-face.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://minimatefactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/paint.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://minimatefactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/paint.jpg&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you get images that look a lot like mixed paint.  Stir various blotches of paint, and the paint gets distorted.  The more you stir, the more it mixes and it gets harder and harder to see the original image.  The important thing is that the mixed paint is something of a &quot;record&quot; of how you moved your rubber object.  And if your motion of the rubber object returns it to its initial position, there is a function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$ f : X \to X $$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where $X$ is all positions outside your rubber object.  Given $x \in X$ you can ask where the particle of paint at position $x$ went after the mixing, and call that position $F(x)$. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my talk about fibre bundles and homotopy-groups in the previous response was a &quot;high level&quot; encoding of the above idea.  An intermediate step in the formalization of this idea is the solution of an ordinary differential equation, and that differential equation is essentially the &quot;paint-mixing idea&quot; above, in case you want to look at this subject in more detail later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean?  A motion of an object from an initial position &lt;em&gt;back to the initial position&lt;/em&gt; gives you an idea of how to &quot;mix paint&quot; outside the object.  Or said another way, it gives you an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Automorphism&lt;/a&gt; of the complement, in our case that&#x27;s a 1-1, continuous bijective function between 3-dimensional space without the garment and itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find it odd but mathematicians have been studying &quot;paint mixing&quot; in all kinds of mathematical objects, including &quot;the space outside of garments&quot; and far more bizarre objects for well over 100 years.  This is the subject of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;dynamical systems&lt;/a&gt;.  &quot;Garment complements&quot; are a very special case, as these are subsets of 3-dimensional euclidean space and so they&#x27;re 3-manifolds.  Over the past 40 years our understanding of 3-manifolds has changed and seriously altered our understanding of things.  To give you a sense for what this understanding is, let&#x27;s start with the basics.  3-manifolds are things that on small scales look just like &quot;standard&quot; 3-dimensional Euclidean space.   So 3-manifolds are an instance of &quot;the flat earth problem&quot;.  Think about the idea that maybe the earth is like a flat sheet of paper that goes on forever.  Some people (apparently) believed this at some point. And superficially, as an idea, it&#x27;s got some things going for it.  The evidence that the earth isn&#x27;t flat requires some build-up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Triangles_%28spherical_geometry%29.jpg/300px-Triangles_%28spherical_geometry%29.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, so 3-manifolds are the next step.  Maybe all &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt; isn&#x27;t flat in some sense.  That&#x27;s a tricky concept to make sense of as space isn&#x27;t &quot;in&quot; anything -- basically by definition whatever space is in we&#x27;d call space, no?  Strangely, it&#x27;s not this simple.  A guy named Gauss &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;discovered that there is a way to make sense of space being non-flat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; space sitting in something larger. Meaning curvature is a relative thing, not something judged by some exterior absolute standard.  This idea was a revelation and spawned the idea of an &lt;em&gt;abstract manifold&lt;/em&gt;.  To summarize the notion, here is a little thought experiment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a rocket with a rope attached to its tail, the other end of the rope fixed to the earth.  The rocket takes off and goes &lt;em&gt;straight&lt;/em&gt; away from the earth.  Years later, the rocket returns from some other direction, and we grab both loose ends of the rope and pull.  We pull and pull, and soon the rope is tight.  And the rope doesn&#x27;t move, it&#x27;s taut. &lt;em&gt;as if&lt;/em&gt; it was stuck to something.  But the rope isn&#x27;t touching anything except your hands.  Of course you can&#x27;t see all the rope at one time as the rope is tracing out the (very long) path of the rocket. But if you climb along the rope, after years you can verify: it&#x27;s finite in length, it&#x27;s not touching anything except where it&#x27;s pinned-down on the earth.  And it can&#x27;t be pulled in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what a topologist might call a &lt;em&gt;hole in the universe&lt;/em&gt;.  We have abstract conceptions of these types of objects (&quot;holes in the universe&quot;) but by their nature they&#x27;re not terribly easy to visualize -- not impossible either, but it takes practice and some training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1970&#x27;s by the work of many mathematicians we started to achieve an understanding of what we expected 3-manifolds to be like.  In particular we had procedures to construct them all, and a rough idea of how many varieties of them there should be.  The conjectural description of them was called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;geometrization conjecture&lt;/a&gt;. It was a revelation in its day, since it implied that many of our traditional notions of geometry from studying surfaces in 3-dimensional space translate to the description of all 3-dimensional manifolds.   The geometriztion conjecture was recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_of_the_Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;proven&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot of this theory is that in some sense 3-dimensional manifolds &quot;crystalize&quot; and break apart in certain standard ways.  This forces any kind of dynamics on a 3-manifold (like &quot;paint mixing outside of a garment&quot;) to respect that crystalization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do I find a garment you can&#x27;t turn inside-out?  I manufacture one so that its exterior crystalizes in a way I understand.  In particular I find a complement that won&#x27;t allow for this kind of turning inside-out.  The fact that these things exist is rather delicate and takes work to see.  So it&#x27;s not particularly easy to explain the proof.  But that&#x27;s the essential idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: To say a tad more, there is a certain way in which this &quot;crystalization&quot; can be extremely beautiful.  One of the simplest types of crystalizations happens when you&#x27;re dealing with a finite-volume &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_3-manifold&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;hyperbolic manifold&lt;/a&gt;.  This happens more often than you might imagine -- and it&#x27;s the key idea working in the example in my previous response.  The decomposition in this case is very special as there&#x27;s something called the &quot;Epstein-Penner decomposition&quot; which gives a canonical way to cut the complement into convex polytopes.  Things like tetrahedra, octahedra, icosahedra, etc, very standard objects.  So understanding the dynamics of &quot;garments&quot; frequently gets turned into (ie the problem &quot;reduces to&quot;) the understanding of the geometry of convex polytopes -- the kind of things Euclid was very comfortable with.  In particular there&#x27;s software called &quot;SnapPea&quot; which allows for rather easy computations of these things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HmOGa.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HmOGa.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Angles from 0 through 300&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: the above may be hard to see, depending on monitor and proximity of face to said monitor. Also, it made from jpegs, so the quality is suboptimal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also see an album showing the results of all angles in $[1^\circ, 359^\circ)$, with an angle increment of $\frac{1}{16}$ (instead of $1$): &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/gp/146544238@N02/u3HA72&quot;&gt;https://www.flickr.com/gp/146544238@N02/u3HA72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Careful of the order of the images in the album. They&#x27;re in alphabetical order, not numerical order. You&#x27;ll see.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It exhibits curiously (or maybe very &lt;em&gt;unsurprisingly&lt;/em&gt; considering we&#x27;re dealing with primes) chaotic behavior (perhaps a very small angle increment is needed to have continuity), but a few patterns can be observed...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angles near $0^\circ$ produce very &#x27;loopy&#x27; results, e.g. $\Delta\theta = \frac{19^\circ}{16}=1.1875^\circ\approx 0^\circ$:&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdFWB.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdFWB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Loopy results with an angle near 0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(This one is also kinda hard to see)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain angles also produce results that have circular shapes in them, but these are more &#x27;spiky&#x27;, producing lots of incomplete circles, e.g. $\Delta\theta = \frac{2803^\circ}{16}=175.1875^\circ$: &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/lkkxc.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/lkkxc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A &amp;quot;spiky&amp;quot; result.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: $\Delta\theta\approx 180^\circ$. Not sure if this is the reason for the behavior, but I imagine that it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$\Delta\theta=\frac{2262^\circ}{16}=141.375^\circ$ was also curious, because it clearly had to go out one way, come back, and go out the other way:

&lt;p&gt;This does not look like the usual technical glitch from Flightradar24, and FlightAware shows the same track. There was no weather anywhere in the area. There were many aircraft in the area at the time and none of them made any unusual turns. There are no MOA&#x27;s in the area (most of it is over a national forest) and none of the other aircraft seem to be avoiding anything in the area. I tried to see if LiveATC.net had a recording but that&#x27;s Seattle center&#x27;s area and they don&#x27;t appear to have a feed for ZSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t come up with any reason for such an odd deviation. The aircraft arrived in SEA and there didn&#x27;t seem to be any problem. It immediately turned around and made another flight which was uneventful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything that might explain this deviation? Is it just a glitch?&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously the UAE (and Iraq) is a very long way from Australia and well beyond the typical range of one of these aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On TV they literally showed the Australian Prime Minister waving goodbye while the jets took off and flew into the distance, which for some reason seemed odd and made me wonder about how fighter jets are typically ferried to a distant war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kind of assumed they were loaded onto an aircraft carrier and shipped there, but Australia doesn&#x27;t have an aircraft carrier so obviously this isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume they must therefore fly, but:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do they fly hop to hop within their usual range refuelling at each stop? Where would these stops be? I assume they can&#x27;t just refuel at a civilian airport in an arbitrary country and would have to be an air force base belonging to a close ally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do they fly continuously with aerial refuelling? Does the tanker need to make hops to refuel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do they swap their weapons for extended fuel tanks which provide enough range to fly continuously to the UAE?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they actually shipped via regular military cargo ship and the &quot;departure&quot; on TV just for show?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they do fly continuously, it seems like flying non-stop for ~13 hours in a cramped fighter pilot cockpit would be unreasonable (even commercial pilots take shifts), or would they fly supersonic and perhaps reduce this to 5 or 6 hours?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers don&#x27;t necessarily have to be Australia -&gt; UAE specific, I&#x27;d also be interested to know how the US deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan for example and if the process is consistent or depends on the aircraft and location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I know next to nothing about aviation, I find it difficult to imagine that such a mechanical watch (which, for example, simply stops working if it is not moved for a few days) would be preferable to a modern quartz and/or digital watch, which keeps running for years on a single battery, self-adjusts with millisecond precision based on radio signals and even without that signal maintains time an order of magnitude more accurately than any mechanical watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(less important) it&#x27;s part of the after landing checklist, so when it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s done&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was recently checked out on a C182 that I wanted to rent in Florida and when I raised the flaps right after touchdown the instructor shouted &quot;&lt;em&gt;what the &amp;lt; beep &gt; are you doing? You should &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; raise the flaps until you&#x27;ve turned off the runway&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. He couldn&#x27;t provide a good reason though, so when I told him about the things I listed above he simple mumbled something about keeping my attention on the runway instead of fiddling with the flaps lever (which is a something I don&#x27;t even have to think about)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is: &lt;strong&gt;Is it really a bad idea to raise the flaps that soon after landing? Or is it actually a good habit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I noticed that most airliners also wait until they&#x27;re clear of the runway, but these jets have spoilers to get rid of all the lift)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naively unrealistic computer simulations that assume a pilot would divert towards the nearest landing strip immediately after a birdstrike without needing any time to evaluate the damage to their aircraft, attempt to diagnose and troubleshoot the problem, or coordinate with air-traffic-control.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I could understand, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system&quot;&gt;Instrument Landing  System (ILS)&lt;/a&gt; allows an aircraft to be centred on the approach path, assisted by radio signals delivered by an ILS (a localiser and a glide slope), without any visual reference.

What interference could a CD Player possibly produce with the instrumentation to an extent that it&#x27;s more dangerous than with the normal take off,en route, and landing phases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to your question is generally no, but that varies by personal taste as well as personal choice. There are lots of threads on the various watch forums discussing this very topic &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.watchuseek.com/f2/what-watches-do-pilots-really-wear-799468.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.watchuseek.com/f7/do-pilots-wear-pilot-watches-1366353.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.askcaptainlim.com/general-propilot-76/21-are-breitling-watches-worn-by-many-pilots.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The consensus is basically a few things. First off pilots no longer make the kind of money the once did and swiss watches have only shot up in price since say the 70&#x27;s. If you are talking about an entry level professional &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/johngoglia/2013/07/31/what-do-entry-level-regional-pilots-and-mcdonalds-workers-have-in-common/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;pilot making in the very low 5 figures&lt;/a&gt; the chances they are going out and buying a $5,000+ watch is low. Now lets talk function. When you are in the cockpit a watch can be useful (provided you can read it). If your heading indicator fails you can use a watch and your turn coordinator to time your turns which can save your life in the clouds. I generally start my chronograph (omega speedmaster) when I take off, this gives me not only en route time but markers of the half hour blocks when I need to switch my tanks (on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aopa.org/Pilot-Resources/Aircraft-Ownership/Aircraft-Fact-Sheets/Piper-Warrior&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;piper warrior&lt;/a&gt;). For what its worth there is a clock in the plane as well as a timer so I don&#x27;t need a watch but I enjoy wearing one. When I fly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;dead reckoning&lt;/a&gt; I carry an all mechanical &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onthedash.com/Guide/_Stopwatches/f.60-Minute_Stopwatches/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Heuer Stop watch&lt;/a&gt; to time my legs. Again these things are in the plane but I find the hand held stop watch easier to use. Some fancy aviation watches provide flight computers on the bezels like breitlings but there is no way you are reading that in the air unless its really smooth up there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/KX9tM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/KX9tM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;           &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consensus around the internet and from what I have seen is that commercial pilots generally wear digital stuff or nothing at all (most casio and the like). Military fighter pilots where GShock&#x27;s or what ever is issued if any thing is even issued. Some pilots may wear Rolex-GMT&#x27;s or the such but that seems to be those that either really like watches or were gifted it etc. However Pan Am had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rolexpassionreport.com/15149/the-unique-pan-am-rolex-cosmograph-daytona/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;long standing relationship with Rolex over the years&lt;/a&gt;. Pan Am pilots may have sported an albino GMT or a special Pan Am Daytona depending on the era. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex_GMT_Master_II&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The GMT Master was even designed in partnership with Pan Am&lt;/a&gt; and issued to long haul pilots.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a side note there is a group of pilots that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; wear fancy swiss watches. Since the early days of the space program Omega has been the watch maker of choice for NASA and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hodinkee.com/blog/a-vintage-watch-nerds-critical-dissection-of-the-new-omega-s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Speedmaster&lt;/a&gt; has been the watch of choice as seen here on Buzz Aldrin  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex_GMT_Master_II&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/twjQd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some even say that the Speedmaster was used to time the engine burn on apollo 13 which may have in turn saved their lives. It is also reported that Neil Armstrongs Speedmaster Broke on the apollo 11 mission. Here is a comprehensive list of where all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/omega.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;watches reside now.&lt;/a&gt; The watches were worn on a NATO style velcro band that was a double wrap size so it could fit over the suits for EVA. The Speedmaster is still worn in space to this day however modern space suits have a flap covering it, making it hard to see in photos. The official Speedmasters (moon watches) are certified for maned space flight and stamped as such.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/twjQd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6EjyB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to expand on your statement &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...which, for example, simply stops working if it is not moved for a few days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do not stop working, the spring winds down and they will stop ticking however as soon as they are picked up again (and the rotor is spun if its automatic) they will start ticking again. That being said if you wear the watch every day, un like a digital that may die, a mechanical watch will tick perpetually until a component physically breaks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a bit of a tangent, some watch makers did make flight instruments (clocks) for aircraft over the years this is where much of the inspiration for the watches comes from. Elgin made a clock that was used in a few WW2 fighters, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/omega.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/2YCwN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What you ask is true, some of the oldest aircraft out there are flying cargo, and most of the answers here are accurate, but some things are based on false assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question mentions full size airliners so I am focusing on that. I use FedEx as an example because I&#x27;m most familiar with their system. Some things that apply to a large cargo-only carrier may not apply to other parts of the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;To clear up a misconception:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Efficiency and reliability are just as important in freight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuel burn and cost to operate are just as important&lt;/strong&gt; Freight operators are no less concerned with the cost of flying and upkeep of their aircraft than the passenger companies. When fuel costs go up it affects them the same as everybody. When fuel prices soar the carriers often implement &quot;fuel surcharges&quot; on top of their regular pricing to help make up the cost. They want the most efficient aircraft they can fly. It&#x27;s harder to make money if your planes are gas-guzzlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping planes in service is just as important&lt;/strong&gt; Flight delays are just as costly for freight as passengers. Some have pointed out that the inconvenience to passengers has a higher cost to the passenger industry. Not from the freight operators&#x27; point of view. They don&#x27;t want planes broken down any more than the passenger airlines. Being stranded as a passenger is much more of an inconvenience than not receiving your Amazon order. But when you delay a passenger flight you have hundreds of unhappy customers. When a freight flight is delayed there could be thousands of unhappy customers. Some of those customers are very large shippers. If you screw up too many times they may jump ship for another carrier. Losing a big source of revenue like that can have quite a sting financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&#x27;s more than just airside.&lt;/strong&gt; For the passenger airlines that move freight and other airport to airport services mechanical delays impact their schedules. But for freight companies that also deliver the freight there is an entire network of employees, much larger than the airside component, that can be left unproductive. I work as a driver and when one of our flights comes in late for mechanical reasons (or any reason) there are 50 of us and 10 or so handlers and sorters standing around on the clock twiddling our thumbs. Our ramp serves 3 large and 4 small stations, so that one late flight can mean overtime for a couple hundred people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Reasons why older aircraft remain in freight service longer:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Longer life span due to different patterns of use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo aircraft spend more time on the ground.&lt;/strong&gt; On average passenger airlines have an easier time keeping their aircraft busy. The difference may not be as much as some suspect, though, at least in the case of FedEx. It&#x27;s hard to find solid numbers on this. Taking a look at flight histories on flightaware of a random sample of FedEx planes and comparing them to similar passenger airliners I found that the passenger aircraft made about 6-8 flights per day whereas the FedEx planes were making 4-6 daily flights. An aircraft on the ground is still not making money. This is no less true for a freighter than a passenger plane. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer short hops&lt;/strong&gt; The advantage of air freight is that it can cover long distances in a short time. For shorter distances freight can be moved by truck in a similar time for a lot less money. Airlines often make several short hops to keep the seats full. Inter-continental transport is where the air advantage is truly significant. Air is often the only way to move freight in a timely manner. The wear and tear on a plane depends much less on the time or distance it flies. The biggest factor for airframe longevity is pressurization and depressurization cycles. The most wear and tear on engines, brakes, undercarriage, etc come at takeoff and landing. So the longer the flights the longer a plane will last. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Passenger comfort&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passengers prefer newer planes&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it be the perception of more safety or the greater comfort of newer, quieter aircraft or the bells and whistles often built into newer planes, passengers would rather fly on newer aircraft. Freight doesn&#x27;t care so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interior wear and tear&lt;/strong&gt; One place where aircraft have a lot of wear is the interior. This is mostly cosmetic, but seat cushions sag, upholstery wears out, windows get scratched and yellowed. These things can be repaired, of course. But there comes a point when it&#x27;s time to retire it, but the airframe still has many years left in it. Freighter conversion is often the best option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Growth and availability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulation&lt;/strong&gt; Up to the 1970&#x27;s the air freight industry was almost an afterthought. Airlines were heavily regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Board. The board controlled routes and pricing. They also regulated who could fly airliners. Many believed the CAB was overly focused on passenger service and air freight in the US floundered. Even in this situation, the airlines began buying dedicated freighters. The 747 was designed around the concept of being a freighter. The cockpit was put on top to make it easier to load freight containers resulting in the famous &quot;hump.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deregulation&lt;/strong&gt; When FedEx was formed in the early 1970&#x27;s as a freight only airline they started out with a fleet of small Dassault Falcon 20 jets. By the late 70&#x27;s they had outgrown the Falcons, but were still not able to move to bigger aircraft due to regulations. In 1977 the air freight industry was taken from CAB control and deregulated. There was suddenly a need for larger freighters. The handful of companies manufacturing airliners can only make so many planes a year, so they began buying passenger 727&#x27;s and DC-10&#x27;s as they became available and converted them to freighters. Fortunately for them deregulation hit Branniff Airlines hard and they soon folded making their large fleet of 727&#x27;s available for freight conversion. FedEx flew these 727&#x27;s long after the passenger services retired them. Several of the DC-10&#x27;s are still flying today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid growth&lt;/strong&gt; FedEx fleet of dedicated freighters is the 5th largest in the world, including passenger lines. The industry expanded rapidly and the passenger airlines had a head start on aircraft purchasing. The freight services joined the new aircraft purchase game. FedEx was the launch customer for the newly minted MD-11, getting the first six aircraft off the line. They have orders still pending for new 777&#x27;s and were one of the first to order the A-380, although the economic downturn of 2008 caused them to cancel that order and change it to 777&#x27;s. But aircraft are built slowly and there are a lot of airlines needing them. To keep up with the needs for large freighters they can&#x27;t afford to let go of the DC-10&#x27;s in the fleet. The need for efficiency still affects freight operators so they had their DC-10&#x27;s upgraded to MD-10&#x27;s which only require two pilots. As they are able to replace them with newer, more efficient aircraft they will eventually be able to send the DC-10&#x27;s to their retirement homes in New Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unable to find any good data on number of flights and flight hours, I got creative. This is really unscientific, but I looked up flight histories month to date on 6 random similar aircraft (B777) from United Airlines and FedEx. Here is a table of the results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/czlZR.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/czlZR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit surprised that the number of flights were so close. The UA aircraft spent slightly more hours in the air and the FedEx aircraft spent slightly more time on the ground&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, such a small sample from two airlines is not very scientific. I&#x27;m not sure if this would bear itself out over the entire fleet, but I can&#x27;t find numbers anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

INSERT INTO postinstance (post_id, user_id, description) VALUES (280, 98, "&lt;p&gt;I would say that the factor that differs most between passenger and freight is the &quot;Value of Reliability&quot;.  A passenger flight has a very high cost of unscheduled unavailability.  Especially in hub and spoke networks, a plane being late or cancelled causes follow-on problems as passengers miss connecting flights. There is a cost in customer satisfaction, and extra expenses.  And, presumably, customers value their own time or their employers do, so time wasted is value lost.  In freight, reliability is also important, but the costs of being delayed may not be nearly as high.  When it is, newer planes will be used.  Factors that make freight reliability worth paying for are:  perishable cargo, cost of being out of stock, need for cargo for a production process, and high value cargo which has an intrinsic interest cost.  A need for a parcel to make it to a hub on time would also make the Value of Reliability higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transportation analysis uses the Base Cost, Value of Time and Value of Reliability to help determine what trade-offs are more tolerable.  The terms &quot;Willingness-to-Pay&quot; and &quot;Willingness to Accept&quot; are used, and market participants are surveyed in a sophisticated way to figure out what values they put on trade-offs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older aircraft have more time needed for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, and can&#x27;t be tightly scheduled if there is a high cost for not arriving on time.  But, they are cheaper.  As far as &quot;Value of Time&quot;, new and old planes are about the same speed in the air, but the time between flights can be longer for freight -- one per day, not several.  Maybe the freight company can schedule your flight when they have a plane in position.  Maybe this doesn&#x27;t work when you&#x27;re shipping racehorses--expect to pay more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some kinds of freight fit the characteristics that the freight&#x27;s time isn&#x27;t really valuable and being late won&#x27;t cause too much of a problem.  For these products, customers expect a corresponding lower base cost than the cost of a passenger ticket per pound.  Most freight also has a lower Value of Time than passengers -- your package is OK with a 3-day journey, but passengers would not be.  To meet the the lower cost necessary to satisfy freight customers, who have a lower penalty (loss of economic utility) for delays, older planes can do the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older planes are not &quot;unreliable&quot; in that safety is not directly related to aircraft age, it&#x27;s just that some components are going to have to be removed more often than on a new plane, and therefore &quot;availability reliability&quot; will be lower.&lt;/p&gt;

The upside: A cargo plane crew will fly quite diverse routes. The downside: Capacity utilisation is much worse. This shifts the balance of cost such that fixed cost must be much lower than what is possible with scheduled services. As a consequence, older aircraft with much lower depreciation cost are preferred. With them it is less costly if they don&#x27;t move for some hours or even days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating cost are more important when the aircraft flies as much as technically possible. Especially low cost airlines need to operate hardware with the lowest operating cost possible so they survive the next price war. Premium airlines also have a need for the newest planes: This makes them look premium and more safe. Cargo operators have no such incentive to prefer the newest airplanes; they profit from the need of passenger airlines to sell their older hardware off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Economist wrote in April 2013 about Norwegian Air Shuttle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As fuel prices soared in the mid-2000s, and competition from the likes
  of Ryanair and easyJet intensified, Mr Kjos realised that the only
  route to survival was to buy lots of new, fuel-efficient planes to
  achieve economies of scale, and to base some of them in cheaper
  countries. Boeing and Airbus are straining to keep up with booming
  demand for new aircraft, so by reserving a large chunk of their
  delivery slots NAS is denying potential rivals the chance to refresh
  their fleets with better planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an airline is large enough, ordering new aircraft has the added benefit of saturating supply and denying the same aircraft to its competitors. If oil prices are high, this airline will have won the price war before it started in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the cargo aircraft are older passenger aircraft that have been converted into cargo aircraft. As a result, the capital costs are lower compared to that of the passenger aircraft. Your aircraft is cheaper, and as a result, you have more leeway in direct operating costs (compared to passenger aircraft, that is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAIRTRANSPORT/Resources/515180-1262792532589/6683177-1268747346047/air_cargo_ch4.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;World bank report notes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The average operating cost of an aircraft in flight is computed by dividing the direct operating costs plus  capital  costs  by  the  number  of  hours  of  aircraft  operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The capital costs for air freighters are a relatively small part of total operating costs because of their age. The common practice of all-cargo airlines and combined carriers is to purchase used passenger aircraft and  convert them by adding loading ramps. After 10 years of operation, the price of an aircraft will have decreased by at least 50 percent and after 15 years by 65-70   percent ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it all boils down to cost efficiency- whether the savings due to improved fuel efficiency of newer models offset the higher capital costs required to acquire them in the first place; as long as this expenditure is not justified, the aircraft will continue to be old and this trend is &lt;a href=&quot;http://avolon.aero/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WFF_2014.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;expected to continue in the near future&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;1800 passenger aircraft are forecast to be converted for cargo use over the next 20 years , 60% of which will be narrowbody types, predominantly 
  from A320, 737 and 757 families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing about cargo aircraft is that the pricing is dependent on the LOS (Level of Service) offered- higher cost for a better LOS. By offering improved LOS, the cargo airlines can improve their direct revenue unlike the scheduled passenger flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it is not entirely true that all cargo aircraft are old. Integrators (Companies which manage an operate the entire logistical chain from door to door) prefer newer aircraft as they are more efficient, while pure cargo airliners prefer the other way. For example, the Boeing 767 frieghter line is solely dedicated to FedEx.&lt;/p&gt;

A car can have lots of items on it that are intimidating to anyone unfamiliar, and just like and airplane cockpit, there are so many of them there&#x27;s not way to &quot;logically&quot; arrange or eliminate most of them.  What are a battery voltage indicator, tachometer, and oil temperature gauge used for?  What are paddle shifters?  What&#x27;s an odometer and why would it be in a car that already has GPS navigation?  Why do I have a separate foot and parking brake?  What does this bluetooth phone button do?  Then don&#x27;t even get me started on some of the exotic controls in race cars, electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, infotainment devices, etc.  Just as a car can be complicated, I would similarly expect a cockpit to be familiar to someone experienced with it, but complex to someone who hasn&#x27;t seen it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7b0iD.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7b0iD.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, aviation cockpits are more complicated for several reasons that aren&#x27;t fully covered in other answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, aviation requires some of the same tasks in more complicated ways than a car.  Simplifying these controls would often require changing the entire aviation industry to reconcile and simplify technologies that were adopted at different times, for different purposes, with different strengths and failure modes.  For example, instead of GPS and dead reckoning being the only navigation options like in your car, in a plane you can have GPS, VOR, DME, ADF, ILS, and sometimes even other navigation options, each with their own indicators and controls. Instead of just using your hands-free bluetooth connection to communicate, you now have the ability to set transponder codes, set up a standby frequency, and check the morse code identifier of the station you&#x27;re calling, as well as possible datalink options like ACARS.  See the image below for an example of how complicated sucha radio stack can be.  Instead of climate controls for you and maybe even separate ones for the passenger, you also now have separate controls for the cabin and cargo area. Instead of a blind spot warning indicator light, you have TCAS and ADS-B to help you avoid traffic.  Not all aircraft are more complicated like this.  Simpler vehicles like gliders have fewer of these complex controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHaEdm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHaEdm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some functions that are fairly exclusive to aviation, so it could be said that due to the very nature of aviation the controls are more complicated.  Due to low visiblity flying you need extra indicators like a the artificial horizon. In part because of low visibility conditions there are indicators for the extra degrees of freedom like slip, angle of attack, and altitude.  Similarly, you have more control surface variations and configuraitons like flaps, landing gear, and speed brakes in planes than other forms of transportation.  Again, many of these extra complications are not necessary on simpler aircraft like gliders and ultralights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the extra features for maintenance controls that make the cockpit more complicated.  As others have pointed out, if almost anything breaks on a car or boat you can get to safety quickly.  In an airplane that isn&#x27;t true.  As such you need backup backup displays, more complicated fuel flow controls, fire extinguishers, extra gauges to warn about dangerous situations like a turbine temperature gauge, and safety features to disable inoperative systems like circuit breakers and feathering controls.  In summary, for safety you may need manual controls for things that could be automatic, extra displays and indicators, and extra buttons and switches to activate safety features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, airplane cockpits are complicated for several reasons.  First, they&#x27;re unfamiliar to you and so of course they seem foreign and confusing.  Second, aviation has developed some complex and often redundant devices for accomplishing even simple tasks like navigation, so simplifying the user interface would either involve removing important features or standardizing, grouping, and unifying industry technologies to eliminate redundancies while maintaining all the strengths of each.  Third, aviation as an industry is more complicated.  Navigating in six degrees of freedom at high altitude in zero visibility requires a little more complexity.  Finally, the high safety demands of aviation demand more controls and indicators to maintain safe flying even in unusual conditions and failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the lighting this picture was clearly taken around mid-day. We can look at the history of recent presidential visits to the Seattle area to see when Air Force One would have been on the runway around that time.&lt;/p&gt;

If this photo is from 2015 it would have to be a landing. However, those photos show a more hazy/overcast sky while the OP photo looks more clear.&lt;/p&gt;

The shadows seem to suggest that the OP photo was earlier than 1500 local (hangars still in daylight, see 2010 photos) but it would still be more plausible than a departure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 2014 - AF1 flew to KPAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 2013 - AF1 flew to KSEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February 2012 - AF1 flew to KPAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 2010 - AF1 flew into KBFI, looking for a good reference.&lt;/p&gt;

On a 747 they extend to around 45 degrees (flaps 30, but they curve around more than that) for landing and have a huge, unmistakable profile.  Further, we know it&#x27;s KBFI and we know the plane is on 31L from the photo.  Looking at the area we can deduce... (click for bigger)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...that the plane is about 3500ft into the runway proper, and 4500ft if we count the displaced threshold (and just off the ground) with the face of the southmost Jorgensen Forge building visible in the background (along with the green GA hangars).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yr1yv.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yr1yv.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 3500-4000ft into the runway, hovering over the last markers in the TDZ, this seems quite late to be a landing.  It might be a very deep float, but I would expect more precision from an Air Force pilot flying the CINC around.  Air Force One is heavier empty, but probably overall lighter than a loaded 747-200 (and has powerful engines), so a 4000ft takeoff run for a light 747-200/VC-25 is sensible and probably more likely than an extremely late landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flaps are more than minimum for takeoff, but seemingly less than normal for landing. Maybe 31L was running shortened that day?  Entry at B10 onto the displaced threshold would also give them an extra 1000ft - V1 just past the aim point and rotate near the end of the TDZ markers seems sensible enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running a series of simulations, it seems difficult for the VC-25 to be able to takeoff from where we see it, even when starting from B10. The VC-25 is 525,000lbs empty.  With only 100,000lbs load (fuel+people) it can takeoff by B5 at flaps 20, but only by lifting off below V2 (no wind).  This has to be a landing (confirmed by the newly discovered set of photos), but it is a very late landing indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s it&#x27;s taking off because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wheels appear to be spinning (though the picture is kinda grainy so...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&#x27;t any smoke behind the tires, even though it would have just touched down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nose angle looks a little high for a landing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The flaps look like they are set for take off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, here is a 747 landing.  You&#x27;ll note the flaps are extended much further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mueEZ.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mueEZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah...  I&#x27;d say it was taking off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT--  I&#x27;ve had a long hard think about it and I&#x27;ve come to this conclusion:  &lt;strong&gt;It can&#x27;t be determined if the plane is taking off or landing from the picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?  Well, let&#x27;s examine the evidence...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tires -- Either they just made contact and haven&#x27;t produced any smoke yet, or, they pilot managed to land it so gently that there&#x27;s simply no smoke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flaps -- They don&#x27;t look fully extended to me, but it&#x27;s very hard to see the inboard flaps, and it&#x27;s completely possible they are fully extended&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location -- Yes, as J... established, it&#x27;s roughly 4000 ft down the runway.  But perhaps the pilot was just having a bay day and floated it a bit.  There&#x27;s 6000 ft of runway left, they can still stop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nose Angle -- As fooot pointed out, it&#x27;s entirely possible the nose is high because the plane is being flared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking Off&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tires -- They wouldn&#x27;t be smoking because they are being lifted off the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flaps -- They are definitely beyond Flaps 10 (normal configuration) but they may have them at Flaps 20 (which is an alternate procedure, from what I&#x27;ve read.)  This actually reduces take off speed by 7 knots if, for some reason you want to get off the ground quickly.  Which leads to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location -- If the plane is mostly empty (no press, just a couple people) and it&#x27;s configured to Flaps 20, it&#x27;s entirely possible to get off the ground in 4000&#x27;, sometimes less.  (I need a citation, I came across this doing a bunch of research last night, I swear!)  If you combine that with J...&#x27;s idea that perhaps the plane entered at taxiway B10, then the plane could easily get off the ground by the time it reach that location &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; it is in the configuration I&#x27;ve described (Flaps 20, lightly loaded).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nose Angle -- Well, it looks to me like it&#x27;s angling up for lift.  But again, this can go either way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;  Seriously folks, this can go in either direction.  This has basically become the &quot;Blue Dress&quot; of Aviation.SE.  You can&#x27;t easily tell if it&#x27;s taking off or landing from the picture.  Now, if someone else who was there that day could show up...maybe with weight and balance numbers...and some idea of how quickly Air Force One may have wanted to take off...maybe a grainy sound recording from the grassy knoll...and maybe a full video, verified by an independent panel of plane watches, the FAA, The Air Force, and the NTSB...  Then we&#x27;d know ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as it stands, it simply isn&#x27;t possible to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_02_09/pdfs/AERO_Q209_article04.pdf&quot;&gt;this document from Boeing&lt;/a&gt;, a typical liftoff attitude for a 747-400 is 10°. (The VC-25 in the picture is a modified 747-200, but none of the various aircraft in Boeing&#x27;s diagram show a liftoff attitude of less than 7°).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the recommended rotation rate is 2 to 3 degrees per second, so if this image shows a departure, we must be looking at a moment only about &lt;strong&gt;two seconds&lt;/strong&gt; after rotation was initiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the aircraft in the picture is definitely airborne (no matter which part of the picture is the runway, it is unmistakable that &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the main gear bogies have all four wheels on the ground), I conclude that it cannot be a takeoff&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; at least not an ordinary uneventful one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flaps definitely aren&#x27;t fully extended, but they&#x27;re extended more than the minimum for takeoff.  This means that more analysis has to happen before taking the position of the flaps as definitive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the runway is short, both takeoff and landing would have more flaps than if it were long, and the somewhat intermediate flap setting there would make sense for takeoff, not at all for landing.  If the runway is long, you&#x27;d expect a lesser flap setting for takeoff, and the flaps shown might be reasonable for landing. Don&#x27;t know what their practice is to always land full flaps or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the GA hangars in the background, I&#x27;ll go out on a limb and guess that the runway isn&#x27;t 10,000&#x27; long, and thus the flap setting is more appropriate for a short-field takeoff, rather than this being landing on a long runway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, the absence of spoilers isn&#x27;t definitive, they take some amount of time to extend upon touchdown. Likewise, reverse thrust deployment wouldn&#x27;t occur until the aircraft is definitely on the ground, so its absence in the photo doesn&#x27;t drive any conclusion either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best thought is, it&#x27;s a takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csdWLWASfSQ&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a video of it taking of at Boeing Field on 13R (the same runway, but opposite direction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the B4 taxiway mark is clearly visible in the video. By counting the number of taxiway marks and comparing it to the airport chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/CvOMl.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/CvOMl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takeoff run began at the beginning of 13R&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotation is initiated when the plane passes B5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airborne is achieved around B7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that makes up, well, ~75% of runway length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following &lt;a href=&quot;http://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/34609/3386&quot;&gt;J...&#x27;s answer&lt;/a&gt;, we can see the plane is somewhere
between A10 and A9 when it touches down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also agree that the flaps setting is more than a conventional takeoff but less than a conventional landing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would Air Force One add more flaps for a short-field takeoff? Unlikely. They don&#x27;t carry as much passengers and cargo, they have 4 engines, each engine is more powerful than a typical B747 engine, and they have a 10,000 feet runway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The image is either taken moments after takeoff, or a split second before touchdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that the wheels are hanging, meaning they carry no weight of the aircraft at that point. If this was a takeoff, then rotation would have been initiated somewhere near the PAPI lights, between A10 and A11. How can it accelerate to Vr within such short distance?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I conclude: the plane is landing with a faster-than-average approach speed and a less-than-average flap setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, they look very similar. @JayCarr stated that the nose angle of the plane looked too high for a landing. However, it is within the safe range airplanes are required to keep while landing (what that is, I have no idea). However, @fooot stated that the angle of the flaps indicated it was landing. That is not completely true. Yes, the angles of both the nose and flaps can indicate landing, but they can also indicate takingoff. Judging by the flaps, state of tires, and likeliness of the picture being taken in landing or liftoff, I would say this plane is landing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to take a picture of a plane taking off, I&#x27;m sure you would have done it while it stil had some of its wheels on the ground. But if you wanted to take a picture of a plane landing, you would probably do it while it was still in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be right, I could be wrong. But I do encourage the community to solve this puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Just a tip, @JayCarr, you said &quot;The wheels would not be level if it were in the air&quot;. The wheels are not level. If you notice the angle of the white line on the runway, you&#x27;ll see that this picture was taken at a tilt. If you turned the image (or your head) a bit to the side, you would see some significant differences with what you stated in your answer. However, you could find something significant, as well. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

I don&#x27;t want to give anyone the idea that air-to-air warfare is something that can be scripted. It is highly complex, like chess, constantly changing, where deception and trickery often win the engagement over technology and a high performance airframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this: A light single prop aircraft, maybe something like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_A-1_Skyraider&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Douglas A-1 Skyraider&lt;/a&gt;, can be a formidable threat when attacking a carrier with even a small bomb hung under the wing. It is slow with a tight turn radius, can fly very low, and has a very small heat signature. All these things can be used to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can add a few things of interest. The guns on the attack and fighter jets were fixed in angle, and aligned above boresight. I know this to be the case for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_F-14_Tomcat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;F-14&lt;/a&gt;. This was so that when you were tracking a target in a high-g turn the gun would be pointing ahead of the turn, instead of behind your adversary in the turn. On the other hand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTV_A-7_Corsair_II#A-7E_development&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;A-7E&lt;/a&gt; had its cannon boresighted, because it was aligned for strafing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a gun aligned above boresight can have its problems. I was on a war-at-sea strike against a destroyer and was intercepted by an F-14 at around 50 miles out. I was cruising the wave tops at around 650 knots. The F-14 stayed in a position above and behind and did not engage me as I flew in on my attack. Later we met back at the ship and he told me that, at such a low altitude, he would have to go inverted to get his forward pointing gun on me to get a kill. He said this was something he was not willing to do, and so he waited for a better opportunity. Perhaps I would pop up coming in to the target for my to delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the more interesting consideration. The tactics of air combat maneuvering (ACM) have evolved over the years. When I began ACM training (1980) in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;A-4 Skyhawk&lt;/a&gt; we were taught that you needed to gain a 6-o&#x27;clock position in the fight, and be tracking your target for at least six seconds to have a successful kill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the mid-1980s things had changed and we were being taught the snapshot. Israeli experience showed that most dogfights quickly degrade in to &quot;furballs&quot; with many-to-many engagements. If you track a target for six seconds in such an engagement you will be dead. Essentially, there is always someone finding themselves at your 6 o&#x27;clock. So we were taught to attempt to position yourself outside the furball and blow through the fight without engaging any particular target too long, taking shots of opportunity. These shots typically had to be taken with large angles and lots of closure. Picture someone crossing your canopy from left to right in a high-g turn. You would use &quot;Kentucky windage&quot; and take your shot so the opposing aircraft ended up flying through the 20 mm cannon shells you fired at 6000 rounds per minute. So much for &quot;aiming.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final comment. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-4_Phantom_II&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;F-4 Phantom&lt;/a&gt; was designed without an air-to-air cannon and carried only missiles. On the F-14&#x27;s, for example these weapons were close in missiles, e.g. the AIM-9, and longer range (over the horizon), e.g. the Phoenix and Sparrow missiles. There was no gun on the F-4, because prior to Vietnam it was thought that aerial dog fights were a thing of the past with the advancing technology. This of course turned out to be a mistake, and gun pods were mounted on F-4&#x27;s to give them a close-in capability, while at the same time sacrificing performance.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Turkish_War&quot;&gt;earliest aereal combats&lt;/a&gt; used indeed handguns which were pointed at the adversary by the pilot. But it soon became obvious that only the rapid fire of a machine-gun will give the pilot a realistic chance of hitting a fast-moving target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Italo-Turkish war of 1911 and 1912, the Italians used aircraft in war for the first time. Since the Ottoman Empire had no air force yet, the Turks engaged European aviators who flew their own aircraft, taking a handgun along to shoot at the Italians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same was tried in the opening months of WW I, but it soon became obvious that only a machine gun was effective. Before gun synchronisation was invented, &lt;a href=&quot;http://militaryanalysis.blogspot.de/2013/03/pushers-ww1.html&quot;&gt;pusher designs were fielded&lt;/a&gt;, some of which carried a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers_F.B.5&quot;&gt;dedicated gunner&lt;/a&gt; in a seat ahead of the cockpit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5L8Y.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5L8Y.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vickers F.B.5 Gun Bus&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Vickers F.B.5 &quot;Gun Bus&quot; (picture &lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-md_7cO-dpHY/UTgSAcvSulI/AAAAAAAADGs/-1-mZ-DQl9U/s1600/Vickers_F_B_5__Gunbus.jpg&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the much smaller and nimbler &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_Eindecker_fighters&quot;&gt;Fokker single-seaters&lt;/a&gt; with gun synchronisation made such designs soon obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Great Britain prepared for WW II, the firing power of bomber turrets impressed the Generals so much that they ordered a dedicated fighter with a gun turret mounted right aft of the cockpit. The resulting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulton_Paul_Defiant&quot;&gt;Bouton-Paul Defiant&lt;/a&gt; was again too slow and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/aircraft/types/type-details/boulton-paul-defiant.htm&quot;&gt;easily outmanoeuvred by the single-seaters&lt;/a&gt;. Its only successful role was as an early night fighter; when attacked by day it could only join others in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufbery_circle&quot;&gt;Lufbery circle&lt;/a&gt; to defend against being shot down itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dj7KN.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dj7KN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bouton-Paul Defiant F. Mk.I&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Bouton-Paul Defiant F. Mk.I (picture &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/defiant-bpa3.jpg&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). Note the retractable belly-mounted antenna masts which gave the gunner a free field of fire in the upper hemisphere.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another attempt was made by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.migavia.ru/index.php/en/&quot;&gt;MiG design bureau&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s. In a dogfight the pursuer needs to get inside the circle of its opponent in order to score a hit with a fixed machine gun. The Russians thought: Why not pivot the gun into the circle, so the pursuer can fly the same circle as its opponent and still shoot at it? A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airvectors.net/avmig15_2.html#m4&quot;&gt;MiG-17 was modified accordingly&lt;/a&gt;, but flight testing soon revealed that the recoil from the machine gun would push the nose of the fighter down and outside of the circle when the gun was not aligned with the longitudinal axis of the fighter, so this idea was dropped very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I need to mention that rarely are the guns completely aligned with the longitudinal axis; instead, they point slightly up to compensate for the ballistic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_ballistics#Projectile.2FBullet_drop_and_projectile_path&quot;&gt;bullet drop&lt;/a&gt; at the expected distance of the target. Also, wing-mounted guns point slightly inward, again to ensure the bullet path is straight ahead when it catches up with the target. This also means that interceptors will have their guns pointing up slightly more than those of air-supremacy fighters. One particular case involved the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15&quot;&gt;MiG-15&lt;/a&gt;: Being designed to fight large &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress&quot;&gt;B-29&lt;/a&gt; formations, the guns were badly aligned for fighting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_F-86_Sabre&quot;&gt;F-86 Sabre&lt;/a&gt; during the Korea War. The MiG-15 armament consisted of two 23mm guns and one 37mm gun with very different ballistics. In order to ensure that the path of all bullets would meet at the right distance for fighting bombers, the 23mm guns pointed more up, and when used against the much smaller F-86, the Russian and Chinese pilots opened fire at a shorter distance so that the 23mm bullets would fly over the target while the 37mm bullets went below it. This was a major reason for the poor kill ratio of the MiG-15 vs. the F-86 despite the MiG&#x27;s better performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the helmets in the F-15, 16, and 18.  That could be interesting as well.  However, currently in the helo community they are used to point say the M197 gun at the target.  I think in fixed wing, they may be used to point the aircraft.  &lt;/p&gt;
